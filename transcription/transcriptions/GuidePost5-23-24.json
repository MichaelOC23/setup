My next door neighbor moves in. He's a Brit. And we bump into each other, and he he he knew that I'm a software entrepreneur. And I know he's a software engineer. And he asked me what I did as a financial tech. I said, I start off in gaming. I said, there's no money in it. And, and I said I said, what do you do then? And then he said, I'm in gaming. I'm in gaming. I said, oh, did you do, you know, any notable games? He says, Grand Theft Auto. Anyway, so so the the real story is that InvestCloud became, you know, 6.4 trillion. We were gonna do a deal with your handsome man here, Bill. Right. And it would have been a great deal because it would have it would have set us up. We had, like, almost 400,000,000 of revenues. We would have been a 900,000,000, 300,000,000 EBITDA company. We have 80% of Sales. And we would've we would've killed the flow and everything else because that's a proper upscale company. That would've been a beautiful company. And, you know, I honestly believe in time, it would have been even bigger. You know, probably one of the biggest financial tech companies, not through millions of stupid acquisitions, FIS, NECC. None of that sort of nonsense where you end up with, you know, basically a load of software that's crap. And then you you you milk it until there's no more milking to be done. And you know that model. It's just financial engineering. You buy a lot of companies. You buy back the stock. You artificially keep the price up, and then you make some money. You know, Bill's don't like him. Can't eat him whole, but he's a nice guy. And, anyway, we're not like that. We're we're, like, proper engineers. And so we didn't do that deal with Bill for a million different reasons. All the wrong reasons. All the wrong reasons. Oh, absolutely. We would have done that. It was just our investors, didn't like that deal. And then we tried to buy our investors, either. Even though they would have made 700,000,000 in 2 years, that's not bad. Yeah. I'm not either even though they were made 700,000,000 in 2 years. That's not bad. Yeah. But they didn't like that deal. So we set up a thing called JBI. JBI. The the main prize in JBI is a project and, product called Communify. And Communify is a a platform exactly like InvestCloud for mass scale. It's based on a warehouse. Warehouse is slightly different in the sense that it's very, event based, and it's also AI based. Based. So we're already built, and if we have time, we want I might wanna show you some AI. I'd love to. Yeah. Yeah. So you can see the engine in in action because it's a piece of middleware that sits on our data and also last language models. And we've already sold it to United Arab Emirates. So they they've got their Vulcan last language model, model, and the the product on top of it is actually us. So if you ever see that, you're actually going through us. Everything you see is us. No kid. Awesome. Congrats. We we walk. And and then, you know, and then when you look at Communify, Communify is also a low code platform. So Sales as Invest Club, different way of doing it this time. And, basically, we've designed Client portal, a Pfizer portal, most of the planning engine. And in the and we're in the process of building those things onto the platform. Michael can really show you some show you some of that stuff as well. And then where we are feeling reality, we're we're being busy and then all of a sudden, we are very busy. And the reason why is that, you know, basically, 100,000,000 of revenues and, you know, put it together. That's option. That's an that you will know has come to us and saying, look. We just wanna come in at the beginning, but we want you to buy things, Vesmart, things like that. Yeah. And you know so you know that that that particular deal. And they're the 2 big ones, and then we've got another thing we're looking at with a strategic are we under have you signed any NDAs or anything like that? No. We will. Do you wanna do you wanna pick your bronze? Yeah. Pinky brown. Send you let's do it. Let's pretend. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But, like, every joke Starts right now. So but let's do that. So because we'll talk about what's going on. Yeah. So, basically, Edward Jones, you know, David Jubak, adopted us at Citi. Yep. He is the president of Edward Jones now, and he wants to adopt us there. And that's one of the pathway. We worked with Edward Jones. They're our main investor, and we just go that route. The other one is a big strategic partner who you will know. Yeah. Just think you might have bumped into him. And he wants to invest into us because he's got all this infrastructure, and he has no front ends to go into, you know, frankly, the adviser world or, you know, frankly, the, you know, retail world. It looks like someone's calling this. Oh, yeah. Oh, that's never happened in the in the. That's nap time. That's what? That wakes me up. That wakes me up. Can you imagine if you had that as an alarm? That's the elevator. Yeah. Alright. Now somebody's just gonna have a noise machine in the background. That's how years ago, we we were doing this deal with this this Indian dude. And this Indian dude was a a billionaire dude, and he was a really he was a really nice guy. But every time you phoned him, you would be put in a queue with this music that would come on. And then eventually, he would answer the phone, but you never went straight for it. It just went into this queue thing. And it was like this Indian dongle. And then Colin and I used to say, these these guys are sitting there chatting away, and then suddenly the light goes on. You're online, and they go. Every time, Phil. They were laughing so much and, and actually come on the phone. And he said, you guys always are happy. Anyway, back on the software. Where were we? Anyway, so we're looking at a few. And in the next month, we're gonna have to make a decision, really. Yeah. You know, maybe it's 6 weeks, but it's a little bit, you know, we did we're just in that that mode where go you can't go with them all. Yeah. You could go with certain partners, though. Certain partners could overlap. And then, obviously, there's, you know, with a chat with you. Yep. You have some software. You know, whether it might would make sense to merge, communicate with that company outside of this company or however we would want to do it. It's sort of open to my because this is like we know that we want ideally, we'd rather jump to here and have some scale so we can get going quickly. Otherwise, we have to do it the slow way, which is account by account. And Yep. You know, that takes a year or so to just get any credibility. But we are out there. There. Some of the old, you know, and the truth of the matter, you know, under NDA, over in our own company, there's at least a 100,000,000 of our that's gonna ship somewhere in the next year or so. It just will. You know, there's no confidential information there. You know, people knows the numbers anyway. You can Google that. I think I mean, the interesting thing is, you know, I think, that you guys have a better perspective than me, but there was such an opportunity. Right? So it's like, okay. Envestnet keeps falling down. Orion can't get out of their own way. InvestCloud. It was kinda like that was the bouncing ball. Now it's like, Envestnet actually feels like it's I mean, the technology is crap, but they're pulling themselves off the mat a bit. Yeah. Like, they're getting their shit together a little bit. Yeah. Right? I think they had to shake up that team a bunch. They've got a bunch of, well, sponsors that are now swooping in, which I think is exactly what that thing needs. You got a Ryan that I I just think is in a really tough spot right now. And InvestCloud, you know, sadly for your guys' sake, this is is like a it's just a shadow of its former Sales. And I think Jeff's trying Yeah. It's just really Sales like it's, you know, it's just you know, it's cratering under its own weight. Yeah. This is the sense I have. And so, like, our relationship with is effectively dead. Yeah. I mean, for all intents and purposes. Right? I mean, we don't talk to anyone anymore. We don't know anybody. I I don't know anyone. They actually actively refuse to do any new business. Right. Because because we've spoken to Well, Becca just came over. I know. I I know Becca. She's a good. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. And she's, like, it's a disaster there. Yeah. And I feel I, you know, I felt bad for her and, like, she's great, by the way. She's so far, so good. But she gave us some insights. It's like You you know the most important lesson someone's learned here is you never ever buy your options before an event. Oh, one of us learned a very painful lesson that apparently, I was given an advice a little too late on that end. Yes. So don't ever exercise your options too early. So we we've can so I don't know how much you guys know about, like, our our it's funny. We just literally had this conversation strategy session this morning. So I'm gonna I'm gonna ask Liam to walk through. Okay? What what did I walk through this morning? The different personas? No. Start at the top and and sort of okay. What's the what's the purpose? Yeah. Just the vision? What's the 2 sided coin. I think it's worth for you guys to understand that we'll still get into fucking. Scoring you now. Yeah. And Bill definitely jump in as Nope. Nope. I'm gonna I'm gonna let you run. But I think so much of our focus area is just starting at the purpose for this company, which is frictionless investing for everyone. And so just thinking through, okay. Right now, historically, we've really been focused on that back end, and we've been very, you know, diligent at executing on that back end side. But we've started to move away or, you know, just never really focused as much on that front end and middle side Mhmm. Of of the opportunity. And one thing that Bill, Connor, and a few other folks and I were speaking about is, like, how can we more adeptly empower different entities, whether it be enterprises, whether it be non US entities Yeah. Whatever it might be by giving them, like, that full full suite of solutions from that front office, like a front office white label or user interface Yeah. Middle office and back office. Yeah. So that's one thing that we're just really thinking through and and figuring out, okay. How can we just empower them and maybe give them, as Bill mentioned, like, that two sides of the same coin approach, where on one side, you would have the clearing and custody and everything that we've traditionally been good at. Yeah. But then on the other side, offer out as many of these products as possible modularly so that you're able to support entities that may have their own balance sheet and may wanna do the clearing and custody themselves. Yeah. That's right. But through offering them different point solutions That's right. Based on experience. So Yeah. So I can't help myself out. So so I think the step the piece in the middle that I think is important to understand. So so the purpose of Apex, help every person on the planet invest. Yeah. Yeah. Right? But we're not b to c people. Mhmm. Right? And it's interesting. We've had number of opportunities most, you know, most recently, like, last week, big firms, b to c, some of which are Client saying, hey, would you buy us? And Oh, god. Would you buy them? Yeah. Well, like, so far Well, think about it. Like that. Well, think about it. Right? So I think about the biggest wealth managers on at least let's just talk about in the United Sales, kind of on the planet. Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, Morgan Stanley. Yep. Those are the top 4. Not even close after that. Yeah. Yeah. K? What do all 4 have in common? The b to b and the b to c. Yeah. On the retail side. Yeah. K. So, like, k, it's kinda interesting thought notion. Right? It's like, is there a modern version of that? Yeah. The reality is we're not b to c people. No. And I think it become a distraction. I think there's unintended consequences for us as a firm. Right? It creates competition. All kinds of reasons why Yeah. At least for right now, b to c is not really where we wanna focus. Right. But we think about us as a platform. Alright? The one thing I will say is that every dollar invested else. Every dollar. So you're trying 1,000,000,000,000 and 1,000,000,000,000,000,000, and you guys know this stuff on Twitter. Of course. None. Are you thinking of this platform? Yeah. And when Liam talks about 2 sided coin, I think of that platform as one platform that serves kind of 2 different sides of our industry. K? So you build this thing the right way, and we'll get into, like, where it starts and ends. But, like, if you build the platform the right way, you apply capital, modern custodian. That is Apex. That's what we've been Yeah. That's what we talk about our the journey, but, like, if you take the same platform and you thank you. You're welcome. You're the best. Like, that was not good. I didn't like that. It's always the same thing. If if you take the same platform and you just offer it as software Yeah. Could you offer a software as a one big monolith, Sales monolith, but one big platform Yeah. And or b go to market as discrete microservices. Yeah. Right? That make up that platform. Yeah. That's the path on the sort of other side of the same coin. It's the same platform. Yeah. So you think about, like, we're going to market with an ACAT service. Yeah. Right? It's just ACATs. Yeah. Right? And we would walk into Yeah. You know, go back to InvestCloud and say, like, look. Let's partner up. We're InvestCloud. Yeah. Okay. And anybody that uses the platform can sign up to use this kickass real time cloud native ACAT service. Yep. Right? And then it's, you know, landing and expands. Like, okay. They get and this is what we're doing. It's like, okay. Cost basis, tax reporting down the line, which is all the pieces that make up that wealth platform. Yeah. The question is, for us, this is where these this fun conversation with John is, we've drawn the lines historically of Apex sort of in the same place that everyone else in our industry has drawn. Right? In this sort of custodial middle office, back office lines. Yeah. K? The lines aren't drawn in the right place Yeah. From my standpoint. Yeah. Right? And I think the opportunities for the industry do something different disruptive is like, okay. Erase the lines and sort of redraw them. So for us, when we think about that platform, wealth platform and by the way, retail wealth is where we're focused. Yeah. Right. We're not focused on institutional retail US wealth. Yep. K. So let's also qualify that. Yep. Like, do I think it'd be great if we could create this platform and it works in Japan for Japanese securities? Great. Yes. But not not for now. Yeah. So what we're trying to sort of think about is where do we draw the lines for that platform. Yeah. Yeah. Right? Does it include, let's just take the advisory world. Does it take a planning planning software? And, again, go back to the 2 sided coin. Everything we do is gonna be offered as software, so it's gonna be packaged in as part of our custodial plat platform. Yep. K? Both sides of this thing. That's that is the strategy for this company. And so the question is, how far north do we go in terms of defining sort of the boundaries of this wealth platform. Yeah. Yeah. And we don't have a great answer on it. And by the way, that whole world up there Yeah. Isn't really our forte, as you guys know, know, which is why John and I got along so well. Yeah. You know? Like Oh, no. It's I'm good at the shit we do. Yeah. You are. You guys are good at the shit you do. You're a big company. But the opportunity is somewhere in between. Yeah. Right? Which is why we talked about putting the companies there. Yeah. Yeah. And I I think it's you you know what you said about, you know, when I talk to my b to c base, they think differently to us. They're not thinking in the same way, but that is the reason why they're terrible at software and that they're terrible at custody and platforms. They're just terrible. And But they are great at a client experience. Oh, they understand they understand their client. They absolutely do. Yeah. In a better way than we would ever understand them. Yep. And I you know, when I look at it, it's like the these these are the these are the sort of worlds that we live in. And a plant is what he wrote. And these guys notice backwards. Yeah. So a plant within a Client. And he he really initially wrote it about, industries in America. And you can look you can look it up. It's about 19 seventies when it when this was first written. And and, basically, what he said is that corporate America is preoccupied with, integration. So they buy things and they feel like they have to integrate. And his argument is that that is actually the last thing that you need to do. All you need to do is have very set boundaries of how they interact interact with each other and that will give you efficiency. In InvestCloud, if you went through InvestCloud, if you saw our accounting team, because we did, unfortunately, do accounting, but our accounting team looked a certain way. When you saw our designers, our designers are covered in oh, you say you can spot the designers a mile away. They're covered in tattoos. And the accountants haven't got haven't seen a tattoo. Yep. And we didn't ever put them together because they don't they don't hang with each other. They're they're nothing in common. Yep. These guys would be over here and think these guys are, you know, a bit, you know, what would you call it? Branch. Fuzzy. No. In fact, you know, sort of like, you know, not really in touch with the real world. And these guys over here would say, you guys are seriously fucking boring. You studied you went to university and studied accounting? Yeah. Anyway, but here here you got, like, custody land. Here you have software land, and here you have b b to c b to c land. And and really, you know, there's an interesting I'm I'm totally with you, Bill. Here is if you wanna go flat form land, come in this way. And if you wanna go into modular land, come this way. And and the thing is, the truth of the matter is they're very, very different experiences and journeys that you're gonna anticipate as you go along. But then this one just Sales you have to be used to selling it like this. I mean, true from VEST Cloud, you know, we had the periodic table. We had a hyper modular way of doing stuff, and that played very well. Genius. Yep. Oh. Yeah. It really was. I mean, it was Well, people loved it and got us The way that you marketed that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, and there's you know, to be honest with you, you're gonna see we've even started designing the tiles of what humanified products look like, and they're all these squares. You know? And Good reason. I mean, it's just a really smart intuitive way to kind of and it to your point, I've used you guys as sort of the notion around we were just talking about apps this morning. Yeah. It's this notion of, like, okay, connect bundles. How do you bundle things? And it really does actually work. It's not just marketing flat. I mean, that's one part about us. We suck at marketing. We are good at product. You are good Product. It's not I mean, we wouldn't even you know, you are good, and that's why you're so solid, and you're not your your competitors are so much bigger, but so solid, and you're not your your competitors are so much bigger, but so much more crap. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, our conversations with your competitors, You know? One eye has to drop. You know? Yeah. Which is why it's a good opportunity. It's like, you know, that's the you know, the assets are all sitting there. And Yeah. You know, the money's gonna be in motion, and we think, you know, we're gonna be this so this modern version of Schwab, the hybrid between Schwab and Broadridge is is kind of the path for us. Yeah. Let us quickly show you the future. And just I just wanna go I don't wanna do anything else but go to the component store. Okay. Yeah. Because the thing is, for the you guys on a limb, let's show you what the component store looks like. Because, you know, when we build things, we come at it. Our DNA Sales modular. And this time around, what we've done even better is our components are so much more atomic, but also labelled very if you get if you get on a normal airplane, such as, Airbus, you'll notice I don't know if you even notice on the labels on the toilet, this is, like, open. It's actually got a number on you'll now know if you haven't seen that number before. You will see a number, and every part of a plane is numbered with a service so they know what all the things are. Yeah. So you can audit a plane for a set of numbers, and that is the DNA of a plane. And, you know, in that sort of, position, that's what we that's what we've done. And our position, the nice thing about software is that you can do this number and then, therefore, this achieves the biggest thing in the world, which is leverage. And if you can leverage a platform in a in a modular way, for these people, they love you more, not less. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, we're gonna we're going on out there. Hold on. Hold on. So what we've been what while you're pulling up I mean, what we've been, I think, been pretty active on the m and a Client, just looking at different things to fill out the scorecard. Yeah. You booked something. What was it? Arch or something? Arch. Yeah. Arch. Yeah. What is that? Rebalancing platform. Oh, that's right. It's more it's models and things like that. Yep. But, you know, things like there's a UI UX company, SDKs, pretty interesting in terms of, like, you know, the next Apple shows up and wants to just quickly be able to spin up. Things like proxy, which no one gives a shit about. There's a bunch of interesting things out there for Product. So there's pieces of that platform that are floating around Yeah. And not surprising. Many of them spawned during the pandemic or right before it. Yeah. Money was flowing. Built really good Product, can't find scale. Yeah. So it's a good example of proxy. I mean, people built some amazing proxy tools that are much better than the shit that Broadridge puts out there. Yeah. But no one wants to leave Broadridge because they have a that they and they're smart. They're savvy people at Broadridge. They have hooks in, and we're one of them. Like, I'm not leaving. No. I can't. You can't leave. Yeah? No. No. If if I could find someone to buy that actually did it and move my business in a lift and shift, the yeah. That's Marketing. But I'm certainly not gonna partner with somebody other than because they have them. Yeah. Well, it's a good example. Like, there's a bunch of stuff out there that we think is Yeah. Well, substantial if you look at Baldrige's numbers, substantial amount of their revenues are low, like, insane amounts of revenue on that puppy alone. Got it, Michael. Do you wanna just just a quick one. Just a So where we're where we're at, we've, as John alluded to, we've we've built out the platform. So we've got the the, the low code, no code generator. We've got the what we're calling digital warehouse 4.0, which is the modern re it's a more modern than what InvestCloud has version of the, of the data model there. And then what we've done is we've completed all of the designs, and we and we're really in build mode right now for the client portal and the adviser portal UI on top of that. And, you know, as as John alluded to, we'd like things in general square shape, so we we leaned towards the, the the serial numbers, and there there's a couple good reasons for that. 1, the modularity really sells well. It caters to people's desire to buy and customize, but to still deliver in a prioritized way, which has worked out really well for us in the past. So we think that it will continue to do so, but it also gives us the ability to make even even more than we did previously, we're going to configure these things as complete, unique, packaged products with a literal serial number just like they do on airplanes. Right? You know it's this part because it's got the number on it, and you're not gonna put the wrong one into the air conditioning unit or, god forbid, whatever they put on that going door. But the, the The conditioning. Outside air conditioning. Yeah. Outside air conditioning. Right? Yeah. They should be confused. Confusing. Yeah. Like a nut. And, you know, and and, you know, what we spent a lot of time doing, right at the start was actually taking everything we knew about client and adviser experiences and really putting it into those component parts. And so the, you know, the the list here that you see is completely, you know, sort of up to date in terms of its ability to, you know oops. I don't know why. So when when, and so Yeah. Competitively so I get a couple of interesting parts. One is, like, there's a better version of the Invesco. Yep. Yeah. And you can see where we're I mean, it's competitively, like, there's no there's we're under NDA. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like, there's no issues around actually turning around and That that wasn't it. That would pre February, whatever date it was, there would have been issues. Hand handcuffs are off. Great job. Hand. That was 1 and 2. So but but 2 is because this is really interesting to us. It's like the goal is to is to create that sort of front office Yeah. Experience Yeah. For the and and the buyer would be similar to what you're selling. Investify a large enterprise, smaller advisors, both Exactly the size. I mean, at at the end of at the end of the day. This is really interesting. Yeah. So this is the design book. Yeah. So because I'll tell you, what's interesting, John, is like and this is what we're talking about. Like, we can make like, clients are gonna you need to provide Client choice. So let's just say people wanna use this and custody of Schwab. Yep. Fine. Yeah. That's fine. Yeah. People wanna custody Apex and Orion. Yeah. Fine. Fine. Yep. Yeah. The way it works. Right? Yeah. Yeah. But there is that sort of, like, like, sort of line up the stars and say, okay. Yeah. But this and Apex Exactly. Like, there is this is what we were doing back when it was like, let's lean in and figure out how to actually make account Marketing, 8 caps, like That's facts. Either as software Yeah. Yeah. Which is a little bit tricky but Marketing. Right? If you were to go to JPMorgan Yep. And Sales, you draw your circles further down Yeah. And say, say, okay. This platform includes an ACAT service, account opening service Yeah. Yeah. And down, meaning you Sales custody, we can provide software in partnership with our friends at Apex. On the other side is to Sales, like, Apex and walk in and Sales, like, look, There's a turnkey solution, which has eluded us for 10 years. Yeah. Yeah. Super frustrating to me because To them, I'm 2 advisors. And frogs and it's just Yeah. It I'm so tired of it. Right? So as a good example, Orion really leaned in. Eric was a friend of the firm. Mhmm. And now Eric's not the guy and that relationship is shit again. Yeah. And I understand it because she's got her hands full and that place is a mess and she can't do anything new. She's gotta focus on looking backwards at Orion, Natalie. Doesn't help us. No. And and the good news is we're winning. Right? It's like Becca's it's a good example. You guys should talk to her. Like, this firm is rocking and rolling. It's awesome. Yeah. No. We know. It just is and and so, like but the problem is is we're walking into firms. It's like, okay. Well, show us what you have. Yeah. On the advisory front, this is not a that that stars aligned, whatever you wanna call Client. The one that, like, in the middle And and Bill doesn't work. Partnership with us and you in instantly, what it what it what it what it instantly does is is that we gain credibility because of you in terms of the maturity curve. And then we have credibility anyway because they know that we we're lead designers in this area. And we're walking the door like, we already have all the relationships. Yeah. You know, all the people that we all know the same people. We can walk in the room to Mary Erdos. We can walk into Dave Chubak. We can walk into every single name that you can think of. And when we turn up, they say, oh, we know what? We're glad this bit. What was it, Bert? I can't remember who said, call me when the smart pickers everyone was predicting that, you know, that I will go back and the team will go back and we'll sort it out. And, somebody said, I can't remember which one is it? It came from you, I thought. It's almost one of the smart people. Oh, yeah. Yeah. When when we left, obviously, Noelle was the top sales person. Weird. I said that. Maybe. Yeah. Was it was it Yeah. Okay. Tell us when the smart people return. You know? But the thing is that the the They're waiting for the calls. The reality was exactly what you said, Bill. Like some people just wanna come in and Sales, let's change colour. I actually just wanna buy Total Platform. You come in this way. Oh, no. I wanna I wanna do the software experience. Yeah. Yeah. And then later, they move this way or they don't. Yeah. But the thing is, there is a person out there who, you know, we already know because, you know, we're already in the market. We've we've even got our first engaged client where we're looking at their data. Yep. You know, we know who they are. You know, it's it's very easy thing and we'll just get going. But the good news is is that we also know there's a market because, you know, here's a book of business. Well, a third of that book is in play in the next 18 months and it will move. Yeah. Yeah. It's gotta go. It will go somewhere. And the thing is with us from a scratch, it's a little bit, you know, the mature I call it the maturity maturity curve of a company. Because when you start, doesn't matter who you are. If this is time and you start, this is maturity. You start how I don't care who you are. Yeah. Yeah. Because when you walk through the door, everyone's excited to see me and say, oh god, John, what have you got? You know, you know, is it let proceed or what is it? But it does it doesn't go like that. Yeah. Only way you get here is by doing merging into something. Yeah. And, you know, it could be like Communify, you know, an OPEX clearing company and then it operates like this and we go around and then, you know, and it it does that. That instantly has that effect Mhmm. Instantly. And then, you know, and then you can you can actually sign bigger deals here because down here Yeah. You're on you're in There's some early adoption Yeah. Discounts you have to get. Right? We would be signing deals at 2.50, but in reality, it should be 7.50. Yeah. And that's just what we do. We always discount the price initially because we want names. We want the beachheads. And once we've got the beachheads, the price goes up to everyone else who comes in. Yep. We know everyone. Yeah. You've done that. Of course, you've done that. And then we would just do this. Also, the thing on the Marketing, Bill, people would if they saw you and I again with our teams, everyone will go, oh, shit. Yeah. That is sexy. Saying it. Yeah. Yeah. So so but so, like, if we were to draw this platform and put all the boxes of, like, what it what let's go back to the platform. K? And start from the front office. Yep. It's you know, there's a b to c side all the way through to settle and trade through TTCC. Yeah. And we drew every box. Right? Microsoft we call Microsofts. Every Microsofts. And we said, okay. We know the ones we've got. We know the ones we're focused on, and we know which ones we're gonna do next. K? And it's like this swath. I'd I'd, like, love to understand kinda when you think about, you know, these guys hear me say all the time. Let's say say you walk back through the door and it's 24 months from now, 18 months from now. What does it look like? Like, what is it? I can draw those boxes at a high level. Can you take them off? Those are in there. Or if they're in there, is there is there another spot? This is, like, one of one of the static Wait. We need more Can we turn it around? Push down the lever there. Look at that. Wow. We'll just start Marketing on the walls and waiting to you don't mind, but So you've got, you know, settlement. Custody. I'm always afraid of mine the moment I get the because it's not really that legible. But Tell me. Can't imagine what that word could've been. Okay. I'll I'll I'll call it the the ops side of that. So this is, you know, this is whether it's adviser or or middle middle back office. Right? So you've got the digital that you need to have advisers and middle office and back office office teams in play to be able to use. Right? But then it it moves really into, like, the what I would call the adviser as portfolio manager, the adviser as relationship manager, right, where this is a lot more of the goals based planning and the CRMs and the content and the things that actually drives the relationship with the Client, and this is the, like, investment execution and rebalancing and those different types of things. Right? And then you get the and then you get the client experience. Yeah. Right? We are really very focused right there, right, in the mode of of that. And then the rest of the PM part is through partnerships is the plan? Yeah. Because we we we think like just let me do this for a sec, Michael. We think like this bill. We think in pyramids. And and basically, we will say, this is your infrastructure pyramid. You need all of this infrastructure. However, where you get most of the value is the opposite way around. It's like, you know, there's very little this is the differentiation pyramid of value. This isn't what it takes. Lots and lots of shit. And what you guys do is really heavy shit. Yeah. What you're telling me is we're like that little piece of shit on the bottom. God. And I'm full blown up. By the way, I totally agree. And one of the things is funny, literally talked about it this Marketing, and I said, no one gives a shit if you have the best proxy service on the planet. No one gives a shit. It doesn't drive any more clients to you. Not. What drives clients is that private office solution. And what funny. It's saying it's saying, like, it's not to say that we should abandon looking at things like proxy because I actually think there's real value there. Yeah. Mhmm. Because you need the infrastructure to be amazing. And, like, the one part I will tell you is that back to you said about competitors, they're all shit. Mhmm. Schwab, Fidelity, Axos, PMR, they all suck. Yeah. So there's a real differentiation if you could walk in and be like, no. No. Wait a second. You open an account in seconds with no paperwork. Yeah. Mhmm. Like, how the hell do you do that? With that said, we have really this is my fault because I'm a plumber. Have really not cared as much about where you're showing that value is. Yeah. That's right. This is not in our DNA because I like the plumbing part, and we're focusing much more on that front. Bill, the diagram that we would have to do, this this is a client portal stack. Yeah. This this puppy here. This is actually interesting. Okay. And then the the diagram that you have underneath it is the plumbing diagram, which would be you, and that'd be sort of an upside down picture. So Yeah. You can get all of this on this, but you can use all of this as well. Well and and part of it is, like, you guys know this is like, well, you're gonna you're gonna opt obfuscate the custodian. You're gonna say, look. We're gonna take everyone's starter date files. We got you. You use Schwab? Fine. You use Fidelity. We got you. Yeah. And sort of make it such that who cares who you use? Yeah. K? The reality is the the the story that's you know, the the story track is there actually is, you know, sort of a 1 on 1 equals 3. So I go through these and say, like, there is a whole bunch of stuff in here. Going to do adviser. Opening, account overview, money movements Yeah. Where Go to this, dear friend. You you you watch are more relevant when you get to the adviser page. You're gonna just because it becomes, like, closer to to you there. Yeah. Exactly. Right. And so so but you're gonna stay focused on the adviser? Or And the both of those, client and adviser. Just in Okay. Well, wait. Wait. Wait. But this but nothing as it relates to, Marketing Up. Apple shows up at my doorstep. They want a self directed UI UX. Yeah. Right? They need a custodian. They're coming to us. We we would do that as So Yeah. Look. The other project we've But but hold on, John. Yeah. It's very different. I know. Let me just tell you, like, I know this. As you know, I've been in both these worlds. Right? The difference between a platform to support I'll make it up. SoFi. Yeah. Right. UI UX multi you know? Yeah. Yeah. You know, multi tenant platform for that Yeah. Versus what you guys historically know, which is, like, this for, I don't know, Mariner. Mhmm. They are so different Yeah. In a lot of ways. Don't don't lose sight, though, Bill. If you went and saw us in Asia, Citi and things with retail. Yeah. Citi and Chase are both We would never have. We we you know, basically, Hong Kong said, we need 5 challenger banks. And Citibank said, well, we're we're no one here. We're gonna be a challenge, and they got a Challenger Bank Client. And the technology behind that Challenger Bank was us. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So so, you know, we Chris, because I and what I want to figure out for us in a selfishly is I'd much rather have one Sales, throat to choke. I'd rather have one partner that helps create sort of one UI, UX UX solution that spans from the next Weebill Yeah. Through to the traditional adviser in a Utopian world. The problem today is, like, I have to try and solve this left and right. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, and by the way, the last part is it's bookends today. So think about the end client. You walk through the front door. You get a choice of I'm gonna use Webull, Betterment, any of these left Mhmm. Fully self directed, whether it's you're pointing and clicking or not Yep. Or I get Michael, my, you know, FA. FA. Yeah. Yeah. The in between there doesn't exist. There's people that are trying this hybrid thing, but today doesn't exist and partly because no one got has gotten this right. Yeah. Be be wise, I said this 1,000,000 sometimes people. The digital world Marketing the first the first phase of it failed. It wasn't because it wasn't right. It's because the execution wasn't right. That's what's happened. It wasn't that it was wrong. It's just that you got the execution wrong. And also there's there was a belief at some point in the future, it will be pretty much the same. Your experiences will be like, you know, for someone like me, I'm completely honest with you. I'm not sure if you're will be like, you know, someone like me, I'm completely lazy. I just phone up my personal banker. I even move in small amounts of money. He's you know, Brian, my my banker Sales, I feel like you're an assistant sometimes. No. Can't you even move, like, you know, $200 mine was a bit dirty by the end of the day. Right. But, you know, my view on it, Bill, what we you know, you could do this is NewCo. We could contribute, Communify. You could come contribute certain software components into this modular land. Yeah. And then we can go to market Yeah. At these different types of people, and they they are different as you rightly say. Because when you look at what you have to do in retail, retail in Hong Kong, you had to see that system is mad. Okay. You know, everyone was competing with each other. Like, on your phone, I could say to you, Liam, I I guess you as my friend to brag about my stock trading during the day. Yeah. And the scenario that we modelled, this Sales a great scenario. Michael did it one handed. Where's your phone, Michael? Give me give me your phone. Impossible. That's dangerous. So my Michael would be there, and the scenario was this. And Michael did this, like, with all the Citibankers in Hong Kong. He says, I've come into work. Yeah. I'm sort of reading the news and and and and the light on on the on the bullet, whatever. You get get into the thing and then sort of say, not the bullet, but the other trade. And then get into lunchtime, and I do all my insider trading information at lunch with my mates. And then I'm on the way back home, I'm sitting there, and I start trading. And Michael used to trade one handed on his phone. Yeah. And then tell people his Sales, and on your phone, you would see Michael real time trading because they're competitive. And we said, look. We have to wait. They like competing with each other. They bet on anything in Hong Kong. Anything. And then I and then there's, like, I think it was a brilliant, brilliant system. Wasn't it, Michael? That's cool. That was wonderful. Yeah. It was Yeah. I I I like the idea. I like this notion of, like, contributing. I like the idea of new co. Yeah. We should poke at that a bunch. And then and, Bill Bill, look. If you if we if you wanted to get external money in and actually get paid for something, that's true. Or does peak 6 wanna be the money? Yeah. Yeah. We sort of don't really care. Because money is money at the end of the day. Yeah. Just mention board members are different. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It it's yeah. It's really interesting. I again, I think and can I can I keep this? Or We can ship you one. Can you ship me one or send it? I can't quite give you that one because we need it for another. Yeah. But I I'll just I'll just say again on that. Yeah. Just because I think I think part for me is, like, again, part of what's possible is, okay. You know, we we the page we had in here is like, okay. If you took these things and you said, okay. What a 5th page Marketing is the. Is that it? Not? Oh, it's yeah. Fispeech is. Yeah. Yeah. If you go through these things and you say, okay. We went down the list and we said, okay. Draw lines through the ones that Sales, you, you know, you guys in Apex, which of these things, if you actually leaned in and tightly integrated, what would it look like? So I'll give you an example. Right? Early versions of Apex. Yeah. We're pretty cool at what we did, but, you know, it still was start of the day. Now this new platform Ascend This is your platform, Bill. Yeah. Ascend. Yeah. Yeah. It's all real time. So real time position and balances, real time ledger. That's great. You guys don't have to build a damn thing. We just plug in a real time ledger. Now mind you, this goes back to, like, okay. But if you wanna keep using Schwab, this won't work. Yeah. Now the part that is interesting is that you can contribute this code as software. Yeah. Bill, that's what you need to do. I know it's an oxymoron in some ways, but because you own it, you got both sides of the equation. Yep. The problem inside the company, and this is where I think it's would be fun to work together, is the gravitational pull. Right? So So it's gonna make the Star Wars, like, the tractor beam Yeah. Pull inside this organization is always gonna be towards the custodian. Right. Yeah. This pull in terms of SaaS is not the muscle is not developed enough. Yeah. Now we have products and we're what's happening is we build this Ascend platform, which let's just say we're 75% of the way there. So there's real clients. So what's happening is there's live clients on it. Yep. It's equities. What we're doing is mutual funds, fixed income options. And this is what eliminates your reliance on Broadridge? Yeah. Mhmm. Great. Yeah. Fantastic. So by the end of this year, it's now just about adding asset classes to the platforms. It works. There's a lot of clients on it using it for equity. And so does does, Google actually see this? Have they are they aware of what you've done or not? Not? Not really. I mean, I have not been, I have been transparent with them, to a point Yeah. That's right. Where I can hand in my heart, Sales told you. Yeah. Yeah. And the reality of it is, they're gonna be happy to keep us as a client Yeah. Of some pieces of that puzzle. And maybe in this thing, their part are party to this, by the way. So, like, I'll give you a good example. Product, their UI work sucks, but the product of like, the actual processing of a of a, you know, proxy Yeah. It is good. Good. Yeah. They have critical mass. They say they're on the market. I look at them and say, we'll be wed to them forever, and I don't think it's a bad thing. The good news is I won't be wed to them because I have to be anymore. And, Bill, at the end of the day, if we wanted another partner here to get them as another partner's, like, a call away because, you know, you you know they didn't turn up for no reason. Mhmm. And you saw who was there. So I did. Yeah. So He's good dude. Yeah. And, you know, and the thing is, look, at the end of the day, you know, we wanna do something where the culture's right. Yeah. Mhmm. You know, and the the the truth of the matter, although Tim is a really good dude. Culture's not right. The the culture's horrible. Yeah. And I I said, look. You know, we would have to be like AMG or the Antetni comp. We would have to always be outside you because the thing is the the the reality because we're not we're not saying that doing these deals to sell the company. We're doing it to create the platform for maturity to get us going. This Marketing there. I mean, you think about what the the fucking debacle that they have with UBS. Like Yeah. He needs a solution and the thing that he spent I don't even know what the number is astounding. Yes. Yeah. And he ends up with I don't even know. I I mean, does anything work, or did they scrap the whole thing? No. No. No. They they claim various bits of it are live now. And, look, we were working on the other side of that project Yeah. Which was, I forget what it was even called. Was the UBS What was it? Yorktown. It was oh, yeah. Yorktown. Yorktown. Yeah. Yeah. It was Yorktown. Yeah. And Was it UBS? UBS was with Broadridge. Right? UBS is with Broadridge. UBS. And they have the on their adviser side, they have that deal where But it's billions that they've spent. It's b. Yeah. With a b. It is a b. Yeah. It's definitely a b. Well, have you seen how slowly they work, though? Yeah. I mean, there's no urgency at all. When we have a meeting, we'll we look like we're a 1000000 miles now, and that's sort of like, you know, just getting on a push bike and we're driving a Ferrari. Yeah. That makes me sick. Right? Just thinking of how much shareholder value is loaded. Just anyway, maybe I would just say be careful with that one for for the reason. We don't have to talk about that at all. Well, I it's an interesting idea, though, because, like, their deep pockets, they're into a lot of firms. Right? Yeah. A lot of firms that are interesting to me. Ironically, as a good example, Broadridge now uses Apex for cost basis and tax report. So That's good. They've given up on offering those Sales products. They now basically white label Apex, which is like that's huge. You know one deal So we're already Yeah. Kinda down this path with that. One deal we could do, Bill, quickly if you wanted to do this. Just put it on the table. Quickly if you wanted to do this. Just put it on the table. Mhmm. If if you said, we'll work out how we contribute this this. We won't do that jump right off the bat because of, you know, you have to work out lots of things. We're gonna do it from a logical point of view. Yeah. Yeah. But we're not gonna do it through a contribution of software point of view because it's just value in Commercial partners or whatever you wanna call it. Yep. You could invest here whatever vehicle, 15,000,000, and these guys or whatever number you like. Let's say let's say let's just let's just say 15. And these guys, whatever these numbers, can invest 5. So these guys want to invest. I can do a deal with these guys in milliseconds at that price. They want to invest more than that. But we can say, look, we want to use you on you on the on the team. I want Tim on the team just because it inflates some of this model. We don't have to do that either, but you would be the stronger investor. We've got an investment package out there. Some people have got it at these sort of numbers. I can send it to you tomorrow because, you know, we're at that moment. 6 in 4 weeks to 6 weeks time, we are gonna have to shit or get off the pot with someone. Yeah. And when we do, that sort of tied us in a little bit. We have got another bigger deal, but we still could do that as well. But yeah. So when do you think the product v one goes live? Q 3. That's what we're aiming for. Yeah. Q 1, the first I'd be really curious. One of the things that would be helpful, and this I'm glad Connor's here, is to Sales, like, let's let's we don't need to name the Client. But, like, we have a number of big, big Sales. Big deals. Well, I you should Sales, clients that have massive amounts of assets. Yeah. Like Yeah. Close to a $1,000,000,000,000 in assets. Advice a big deal. Yeah. It's a big deal. Yeah. K? We sign a contract. K? Now they're not moving all $1,000,000,000,000 $850,000,000,000 in assets to us, but we're solving for the small client. Yep. Right? Today, they have a minimum. I think it's $1,000,000. They wanna scale down to a $100,000. They can't do that Yep. Unless they do it for us. Yep. Great. Like, that is a rinse and repeat model that we keep winning on. Yep. If we took that and said a couple of those scenarios for just advisory, Let's just stick to advisory. Let's not talk about Apple. And said, okay. Q 3 of this year, what could we sell together? That would be really helpful for me to to get to this, John. Well, you because we've we've got on the investment make sure it solves the Product. That's where send you the investment packet as the timeline. Line. Yeah. And you'll you'll see that a client portal q3, advise portal q4, planning q2 from memory of next year. Yep. So that that's what we're we're thinking on those sort of look, this is a continual bus. They they mature, get more and more and more features, but we know all the feature lists. And we've got a low code platform, so it's fast. And also, you know, look, at the end of the day, that assumes a certain amount of investment. Certain things that you have, we we just not need to put a veneer on it. We don't even have build that much of it as long as it can fit in the component store. Yeah. And it works. I agree. Look. You could grab some of these things as your own or as part of NewCo and not have to build, like, as a good example, position and balances. I got it. Yeah. We built it. So you're done. The cool stuff. Yeah. And you can take a starter day file from Schwab and run it through this thing, and it'll work. And just so we say it out loud, we're all using it now. Yeah. Like, I I use Unify on a daily basis right now. Oh, and we say q Yeah. So so the the platform's live. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, in terms of us using it, you can we can demonstrate it right this second on Michael's phone or my phone or whatever. Yeah. I just I wanna land the plane as far as, like, 3q3q4. If I if we sort of took our timeline Yeah. And we think about the personas we're trying to solve for Yeah. And line it up against what you guys are thinking about in terms of your path, it'd just be helpful to see that. Yeah. Because and it's very fortuitous timing because we're we're there's a bunch of acquisitions we're looking at in and around the space that, yeah, we got same for you, John. I gotta solve this. Yeah. I'm a whole bunch of people. Everyone disappoints me. Everyone falls down. I'm tired of it. And Yeah. We have to solve this. The difference is is that, you know, being part of it is a different vibe, isn't it? I mean, we're not here selling the company as you know, but we were investment partners. However, you know, as long as we have, you know, the things that we simply want in 3 years, we have the right to sell it even if it's selling it to Pete 6 Yeah. Is the answer. You know, you build it up. Up. It's worth a lot of money or build, you know, whatever you want to do, but it needs to have an x because the thing is the value of it today is worth x. The value of it tomorrow is 100 of 1,000,000. Yeah. And we know it's 100 of 1,000,000. I'm smiling because you've commented about exit. I will literally I'll be in I should say this by these 2 guys. I'll be 90, and I'll still own stock. I'll be a I'll pay for billionaire for the rest of the day. My kids and my grandkids will love running. I'll still be driving a pickup truck. You know that paper bill because people used to sort of say to me, but when I had NetTic, I was so and I was young. I was worth so much money, and people used to sort of say, you know, you must be worth a fortune. On paper, yes. Yes, I am. In reality, not so much. But mind you, they used to point out, Bill. I don't know if I ever told you this, but I used to own a stately home. And people would say, you you say you're not rich, John, but you have not. Yeah. Because I I started off in the projects in South London. So when I bought the stately home, it was like my main sister Sales, are you fucking kidding me? And I just said, I bought it only because I cook. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. And I was My wife won't allow it to happen. I I would I would say this. These guys are like I don't I love what I do. I love what I do, and I love the path we're on, and I love the people I work with. And so, you know, we're not gonna stop until we are bigger than Schwab. Yeah. There's no doubt, and it's really clear to me that someone has to step in and be, say, the next Schwab. But like that hybrid of Schwab and Broadridge, that's gonna be us and it'll be a $100,000,000,000 company. There's no doubt in my mind. Yeah. And so but it's gonna take time, and it's gonna take, energy, and I think it's gonna take partnerships with people that, that aren't part of the family today. Yeah. Yeah. And I I think that's the key. You know, plant within a plant greatness comes because of specialization and specialisation and focus. Yeah. And when you don't have to specialise in other people's areas, because we said this time, we are definitely not building any accounting. We're not even building a lightweight accounting engine because it's a pain in the ass, and, actually, to us, it's actually a distraction from this. As soon as you're here I mean, it's an amazing distraction. Way. I mean, it's very cool and somewhat, you know, sort of makes me hopeful on this because, like, you're getting to do the same thing and you learn from all of your mistakes. That's right. Yeah. And do it right this time. Yeah. With a blank piece of paper. That's right. Right? And a team that you trust, which, you know, doesn't happen often. No. It doesn't. In a street that that knows your name and can, you know, and sort of has faith in what you can do. I'll be you know, people generally, you you are our user. People love us. You know? Yeah. We yeah. When did everything wasn't Prospect. Out of 50 projects that we've run at one time, you're gonna have 5 of them going sideways because of a load of different reasons. And usually in truth, never the product or people bullshit issues. And one of the things was my favorite one was, how did they use that component? You know, this component numbering? The reason why it's on there because people used to use the wrong fucking components, and they pick them up from the library. And we're sort of saying, didn't we decommission that component and it's now part of a you know? And you have to go and fix it Yeah. Because someone picked up the wrong fucking thing. Yeah. So okay. So if you guys can send this to me, I mean, I I need to do an NDA. Yeah. I'd love to do this, like, persona thing quickly. Yeah. And then send me the send me the stuff in your investment. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'll send you tomorrow the the reply to my boss. Any by the weekend, you'll get it. Yeah. I have it on my don't worry. I have it on my list. I'll make sure he does it. No one was the best saleswoman in Best Cloud for a reason. I'll I'll get it done. She was lucky. Yeah. Luck. Exactly. You know that superpower? Did you ever see that movie? What is it? Deadpool. Oh, yeah. Yeah. When the when the woman Client and he says, okay, okay, what's your superpower? And she says, I'm lucky. He says, that's a superpower. And if you watch that movie, it's the most hilarious thing because evidently Luck is a super fun. I'll take care of that. Well, at the end when he's got the thing on the neck Yeah. And he's got the code, and he says, what is what is the code? And she goes, 2. Oh. I I will say back to Becca Yeah. The thing that's really interesting is, the companies the DNA of the company is very similar. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I I It's actually a firm. We know that. We we obviously get along really well. Yeah. I could see that, though. But but even now having people in the organization, and we have a few. There's a few people come across from Yeah. Yeah. We got well, John Stewart. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

0: I call the Palisades. My next door neighbor moves in. He's a Brit. And we bump into each other, and he he he knew that I'm a software entrepreneur. And I know he's a software engineer.\n\nAnd he asked me what I did as a financial tech. I said, I start off in gaming. I said, there's no money in it. And, and I said I said, what do you do then? And then he said, I'm in gaming.\n\nI'm in gaming. I said, oh, did you do, you know, any notable games? He says, Grand Theft Auto. Anyway, so so the the real story is that InvestCloud became, you know, 6.4 trillion. We were gonna do a deal with your handsome man here, Bill.\n\nRight. And it would have been a great deal because it would have it would have set us up. We had, like, almost 400,000,000 of revenues. We would have been a 900,000,000, 300,000,000 EBITDA company.\n\nSpeaker 1: We have 80% of Sales.\n\nSpeaker 0: And we would've we would've killed the flow and everything else because that's a proper upscale company. That would've been a beautiful company. And, you know, I honestly believe in time, it would have been even bigger. You know, probably one of the biggest financial tech companies, not through millions of stupid acquisitions, FIS, NECC. None of that sort of nonsense where you end up with, you know, basically a load of software that's crap.\n\nAnd then you you you milk it until there's no more milking to be done. And you know that model. It's just financial engineering. You buy a lot of companies. You buy back the stock.\n\nYou artificially keep the price up, and then you make some money. You know, Bill's don't like him. Can't eat him whole, but he's a nice guy. And, anyway, we're not like that. We're we're, like, proper engineers.\n\nAnd so we didn't do that deal with Bill for a million different reasons.\n\nSpeaker 2: All the wrong reasons.\n\nSpeaker 0: All the wrong reasons. Oh, absolutely. We would have done that. It was just our investors, didn't like that deal. And then we tried to buy our investors, either.\n\nEven though they would have made 700,000,000 in 2 years, that's not bad. Yeah. I'm not either even though they were made 700,000,000 in 2 years. That's not bad. Yeah.\n\nBut they didn't like that deal. So we set up a thing called JBI. JBI. The the main prize in JBI is a project and, product called Communify. And Communify is a a platform exactly like InvestCloud for mass scale.\n\nIt's based on a warehouse. Warehouse is slightly different in the sense that it's very, event based, and it's also AI based. Based. So we're already built, and if we have time, we want I might wanna show you some AI.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'd love to. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. So you can see the engine in in action because it's a piece of middleware that sits on our data and also last language models. And we've already sold it to United Arab Emirates. So they they've got their Vulcan last language model, model, and the the product on top of it is actually us. So if you ever see that, you're actually going through us.\n\nEverything you see is us.\n\nSpeaker 2: No kid. Awesome.\n\nSpeaker 0: Congrats. We we walk. And and then, you know, and then when you look at Communify, Communify is also a low code platform. So Sales as Invest Club, different way of doing it this time. And, basically, we've designed Client portal, a Pfizer portal, most of the planning engine.\n\nAnd in the and we're in the process of building those things onto the platform. Michael can really show you some show you some of that stuff as well. And then where we are feeling reality, we're we're being busy and then all of a sudden, we are very busy. And the reason why is that, you know, basically, 100,000,000 of revenues and, you know, put it together. That's option.\n\nThat's an that you will know has come to us and saying, look. We just wanna come in at the beginning, but we want you to buy things, Vesmart, things like that. Yeah. And you know so you know that that that particular deal. And they're the 2 big ones, and then we've got another thing we're looking at with a strategic are we under have you signed any NDAs or anything like that?\n\nNo. We will. Do you wanna do you\n\nSpeaker 1: wanna pick your bronze?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Pinky brown. Send you let's do it. Let's pretend.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. But, like, every joke Starts\n\nSpeaker 3: right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: So but let's do that. So because we'll talk about\n\nSpeaker 3: what's going on.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. So, basically, Edward Jones, you know, David Jubak, adopted us at Citi. Yep. He is the president of Edward Jones now, and he wants to adopt us there. And that's one of the pathway.\n\nWe worked with Edward Jones. They're our main investor, and we just go that route. The other one is a big strategic partner who you will know. Yeah. Just think you might have bumped into him.\n\nAnd he wants to invest into us because he's got all this infrastructure, and he has no front ends to go into, you know, frankly, the adviser world or, you know, frankly, the, you know, retail world. It looks like someone's calling this. Oh,\n\nSpeaker 1: yeah. Oh, that's never happened in the in the.\n\nSpeaker 3: That's nap time. That's what? That wakes me up.\n\nSpeaker 0: That wakes me up. Can you imagine if you had that as an alarm?\n\nSpeaker 3: That's the elevator. Yeah. Alright. Now somebody's just gonna have a noise machine in the background.\n\nSpeaker 0: That's how years ago, we we were doing this deal with this this Indian dude. And this Indian dude was a a billionaire dude, and he was a really he was a really nice guy. But every time you phoned him, you would be put in a queue with this music that would come on. And then eventually, he would answer the phone, but you never went straight for it. It just went into this queue thing.\n\nAnd it was like this Indian dongle. And then Colin and I used to say, these these guys are sitting there chatting away, and then suddenly the light goes on. You're online, and they go. Every time, Phil. They were laughing so much and, and actually come on the phone.\n\nAnd he said, you guys always are happy. Anyway, back on the software. Where were we? Anyway, so we're looking at a few. And in the next month, we're gonna have to make a decision, really.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: You know, maybe it's 6 weeks, but it's a little bit, you know, we did we're just in that that mode where go you can't go with them all. Yeah. You could go with certain partners, though. Certain partners could overlap. And then, obviously, there's, you know, with a chat with you.\n\nYep. You have some software. You know, whether it might would make sense to merge, communicate with that company outside of this company or however we would want to do it. It's sort of open to my because this is like we know that we want ideally, we'd rather jump to here and have some scale so we can get going quickly. Otherwise, we have to do it the slow way, which is account by account.\n\nAnd Yep. You know, that takes a year or so to just get any credibility. But we are out there. There. Some of the old, you know, and the truth of the matter, you know, under NDA, over in our own company, there's at least a 100,000,000 of our that's gonna ship somewhere in the next year or so.\n\nIt just will. You know, there's no confidential information there. You know, people knows the numbers anyway. You can Google that.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think I mean, the interesting thing is, you know, I think, that you guys have a better perspective than me, but there was such an opportunity. Right? So it's like, okay. Envestnet keeps falling down. Orion can't get out of their own way.\n\nInvestCloud. It was kinda like that was the bouncing ball. Now it's like, Envestnet actually feels like it's I mean, the technology is crap, but they're pulling themselves off the mat a bit. Yeah. Like, they're getting their shit together a little bit.\n\nYeah. Right? I think they had to shake up that team a bunch. They've got a bunch of, well, sponsors that are now swooping in, which I think is exactly what that thing needs. You got a Ryan that I I just think is in a really tough spot right now.\n\nAnd InvestCloud, you know, sadly for your guys' sake, this is is like a it's just a shadow of its former Sales. And I think Jeff's trying Yeah. It's just really Sales like it's, you know, it's just you know, it's cratering under its own weight. Yeah. This is the sense I have.\n\nAnd so, like, our relationship with is effectively dead.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, for all intents and purposes. Right?\n\nSpeaker 0: I mean,\n\nSpeaker 2: we don't talk to anyone anymore. We don't know anybody. I I don't know anyone.\n\nSpeaker 0: They actually actively\n\nSpeaker 3: refuse to do any new business. Right. Because because we've spoken to\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, Becca just came over.\n\nSpeaker 3: I know. I I know Becca.\n\nSpeaker 0: She's a good.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yep. Yeah. Yeah. And she's, like, it's a disaster there. Yeah.\n\nAnd I feel I, you know, I felt bad for her and, like, she's great, by the way. She's so far, so good. But she gave us some insights.\n\nSpeaker 0: It's like You you know the most important lesson someone's learned here is you never ever buy your options before an event.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh,\n\nSpeaker 3: one of us learned a very painful lesson that apparently, I was given an advice a little too late on that end. Yes. So don't ever exercise your options too early.\n\nSpeaker 2: So we we've can so I don't know how much you guys know about, like, our our it's funny. We just literally had this conversation strategy session this morning. So I'm gonna I'm gonna ask Liam to walk through. Okay? What what did I walk through this morning?\n\nThe different personas? No. Start at the top and and sort of okay. What's the what's the purpose? Yeah.\n\nJust the vision? What's the 2 sided coin. I think it's worth for you guys to understand\n\nSpeaker 0: that we'll still get into fucking. Scoring you now.\n\nSpeaker 4: Yeah. And Bill definitely jump in as\n\nSpeaker 2: Nope. Nope. I'm gonna I'm gonna let you run.\n\nSpeaker 4: But I think so much of our focus area is just starting at the purpose for this company, which is frictionless investing for everyone. And so just thinking through, okay. Right now, historically, we've really been focused on that back end, and we've been very, you know, diligent at executing on that back end side. But we've started to move away or, you know, just never really focused as much on that front end and middle side\n\nSpeaker 2: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 4: Of of the opportunity. And one thing that Bill, Connor, and a few other folks and I were speaking about is, like, how can we more adeptly empower different entities, whether it be enterprises, whether it be non US entities Yeah. Whatever it might be by giving them, like, that full full suite of solutions from that front office, like a front office white label or user interface Yeah. Middle office and back office.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 4: So that's one thing that we're just really thinking through and and figuring out, okay. How can we just empower them and maybe give them, as Bill mentioned, like, that two sides of the same coin approach, where on one side, you would have the clearing and custody and everything that we've traditionally been good at. Yeah. But then on the other side, offer out as many of these products as possible modularly so that you're able to support entities that may have their own balance sheet and may wanna do the clearing and custody themselves. Yeah.\n\nThat's right. But through offering them different point solutions\n\nSpeaker 2: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 4: Based on experience.\n\nSpeaker 2: So Yeah. So I can't help myself out. So\n\nSpeaker 0: so I\n\nSpeaker 2: think the step the piece in the middle that I think is important to understand. So so the purpose of Apex, help every person on the planet invest.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right? But we're not b to c people.\n\nSpeaker 3: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right? And it's interesting. We've had number of opportunities most, you know, most recently, like, last week, big firms, b to c, some of which are Client saying, hey, would you buy us?\n\nSpeaker 0: And Oh, god. Would you buy them? Yeah. Well, like, so far Well,\n\nSpeaker 2: think about it.\n\nSpeaker 0: Like that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, think about it. Right? So I think about the biggest wealth managers on at least let's just talk about in the United Sales, kind of on the planet. Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, Morgan Stanley.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: Those are the top 4. Not even close after that.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: K? What do all 4 have in common? The b to b and the b to c. Yeah. On the retail side.\n\nYeah. K. So, like, k, it's kinda interesting thought notion. Right? It's like, is there a modern version of that?\n\nYeah. The reality is we're not b to c people.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. And\n\nSpeaker 2: I think it become a distraction. I think there's unintended consequences for us as a firm. Right? It creates competition. All kinds of reasons why Yeah.\n\nAt least for right now, b to c is not really where we wanna focus. Right. But we think about us as a platform. Alright? The one thing I will say is that every dollar invested else.\n\nEvery dollar. So you're trying 1,000,000,000,000 and 1,000,000,000,000,000,000, and you guys know this stuff\n\nSpeaker 0: on Twitter. Of course. None. Are you\n\nSpeaker 2: thinking of this platform? Yeah. And when Liam talks about 2 sided coin, I think of that platform as one platform that serves kind of 2 different sides of our industry. K? So you build this thing the right way, and we'll get into, like, where it starts and ends.\n\nBut, like, if you build the platform the right way, you apply capital, modern custodian. That is Apex. That's what we've been Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: That's what we\n\nSpeaker 2: talk about our the journey, but, like, if you take the same platform and you thank you. You're welcome. You're the best. Like, that was not good. I didn't like that.\n\nIt's always the same thing. If if you take the same platform and you just offer it as software\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Could you offer a software as a one big monolith, Sales monolith, but one big platform Yeah. And or b go to market as discrete microservices. Yeah. Right? That make up that platform.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's the path on the sort of other side of the\n\nSpeaker 3: same coin.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's the same platform. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: So you\n\nSpeaker 2: think about, like, we're going to market with an ACAT service. Yeah. Right? It's just ACATs.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right? And we would walk into\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: You know, go back to InvestCloud and say, like, look. Let's partner up. We're InvestCloud. Yeah. Okay.\n\nAnd anybody that uses the platform can sign up to use this kickass real time cloud native ACAT service. Yep. Right? And then it's, you know, landing and expands. Like, okay.\n\nThey get and this is what we're doing. It's like, okay. Cost basis, tax reporting down the line, which is all the pieces that make up that wealth platform. Yeah. The question is, for us, this is where these this fun conversation with John is, we've drawn the lines historically of Apex sort of in the same place that everyone else in our industry has drawn.\n\nRight? In this sort of custodial middle office, back office lines. Yeah. K? The lines aren't drawn in the right place\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: From my standpoint. Yeah. Right?\n\nSpeaker 0: And I\n\nSpeaker 2: think the opportunities for the industry do something different disruptive is like, okay. Erase the lines and sort of redraw them. So for us, when we think about that platform, wealth platform and by the way, retail wealth is where we're focused. Yeah. Right.\n\nWe're not focused on institutional retail US wealth. Yep. K. So let's also qualify that. Yep.\n\nLike, do I think it'd be great if we could create this platform and it works in Japan for Japanese securities? Great. Yes. But not not for now. Yeah.\n\nSo what we're trying to sort of think about is where do we draw the lines for that platform.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right? Does it include, let's just take the advisory world. Does it take a planning planning software? And, again, go back to the 2 sided coin. Everything we do is gonna be offered as software, so it's gonna be packaged in as part of our custodial plat platform.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yep. K?\n\nSpeaker 2: Both sides of this thing. That's that is the strategy for this company. And so the question is, how far north do we go in terms of defining sort of the boundaries of this wealth platform.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: And we\n\nSpeaker 2: don't have a great answer\n\nSpeaker 0: on it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And by the way, that whole world up there Yeah. Isn't really our forte,\n\nSpeaker 0: as you\n\nSpeaker 2: guys know, know, which is why John and I got along so well. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 3: You know? Like\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, no. It's I'm good at the shit we do. Yeah. You are. You guys are good at the shit you do.\n\nSpeaker 0: You're a\n\nSpeaker 3: big company.\n\nSpeaker 2: But the opportunity is somewhere in between. Yeah. Right? Which is why we talked about putting the companies there.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. And I I think it's you you know what you said about, you know, when I talk to my b to c base, they think differently to us. They're not thinking in the same way, but that is the reason why they're terrible at software and that they're terrible at custody and platforms. They're just terrible.\n\nSpeaker 2: And But they are great at a client experience.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, they understand they understand their client. They absolutely do. Yeah. In a better way than we would ever understand them. Yep.\n\nAnd I you know, when I look at it, it's like the these these are the these are the sort of worlds that we live in. And a plant is what he wrote. And these guys notice backwards.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: So a plant within a Client. And he he really initially wrote it about, industries in America. And you can look you can look it up. It's about 19 seventies when it when this was first written. And and, basically, what he said is that corporate America is preoccupied with, integration.\n\nSo they buy things and they feel like they have to integrate. And his argument is that that is actually the last thing that you need to do. All you need to do is have very set boundaries of how they interact interact with each other and that will give you efficiency. In InvestCloud, if you went through InvestCloud, if you saw our accounting team, because we did, unfortunately, do accounting, but our accounting team looked a certain way. When you saw our designers, our designers are covered in oh, you say you can spot the designers a mile away.\n\nThey're covered in tattoos. And the accountants haven't got haven't seen a tattoo. Yep. And we didn't ever put them together because they don't they don't hang with each other. They're they're nothing in common.\n\nYep. These guys would be over here and think these guys are, you know, a bit, you know, what would you call it? Branch. Fuzzy. No.\n\nIn fact, you know, sort of like, you know, not really in touch with the real world. And these guys over here would say, you guys are seriously fucking boring. You studied you went to university and studied accounting? Yeah. Anyway, but here here you got, like, custody land.\n\nHere you have software land, and here you have b b to c b to c land. And and really, you know, there's an interesting I'm I'm totally with you, Bill. Here is if you wanna go flat form land, come in this way. And if you wanna go into modular land, come this way. And and the thing is, the truth of the matter is they're very, very different experiences and journeys that you're gonna anticipate as you go along.\n\nBut then this one just Sales you have to be used to selling it like this. I mean, true from VEST Cloud, you know, we had the periodic table. We had a hyper modular way of doing stuff, and that played very well.\n\nSpeaker 2: Genius. Yep.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: It really was.\n\nSpeaker 0: I mean, it was Well, people loved it and got us The\n\nSpeaker 2: way that you marketed\n\nSpeaker 0: that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, and there's you know, to be honest with you, you're gonna see we've even started designing the tiles of what humanified products look like, and they're all these squares.\n\nYou\n\nSpeaker 2: know? And Good reason. I mean, it's just a really smart intuitive way to kind of and it to your point, I've used you guys as sort of the notion around we were just talking about apps this morning. Yeah. It's this notion of, like, okay, connect bundles.\n\nHow do you bundle things? And it really does actually work. It's not just marketing flat. I mean, that's one part about us. We suck at marketing.\n\nWe are good at product.\n\nSpeaker 0: You are good Product. It's not I mean, we wouldn't even you know, you are good,\n\nSpeaker 3: and that's why you're so solid, and you're not your\n\nSpeaker 0: your competitors are so much bigger, but so solid, and you're not your your competitors are so much bigger, but so much more crap. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, our conversations with your competitors, You know? One eye has to drop.\n\nYou know? Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Which is why it's a good opportunity. It's like, you know, that's the you know, the assets are all sitting there. And Yeah. You know, the money's gonna be in motion, and we think, you know, we're gonna be this so this modern version of Schwab, the hybrid between Schwab and Broadridge is is kind of the path for us.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Let us quickly show you the future. And just I just wanna go I don't wanna do anything else but go to the component store. Okay. Yeah.\n\nBecause the thing is, for the you guys on a limb, let's show you what the component store looks like. Because, you know, when we build things, we come at it. Our DNA Sales modular. And this time around, what we've done even better is our components are so much more atomic, but also labelled very if you get if you get on a normal airplane, such as, Airbus, you'll notice I don't know if you even notice on the labels on the toilet, this is, like, open. It's actually got a number on you'll now know if you haven't seen that number before.\n\nYou will see a number, and every part of a plane is numbered with a service so they know what all the things are. Yeah. So you can audit a plane for a set of numbers, and that is the DNA of a plane. And, you know, in that sort of, position, that's what we that's what we've done. And our position, the nice thing about software is that you can do this number and then, therefore, this achieves the biggest thing in the world, which is leverage.\n\nAnd if you can leverage a platform in a in a modular way, for these people, they love you more, not less. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nAnyway, we're gonna\n\nSpeaker 2: we're going on out there. Hold on. Hold on. So what we've been what while you're pulling up I mean, what we've been, I think, been pretty active on the m and a Client, just looking at different things to fill out the scorecard. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: You booked something. What was it? Arch or something?\n\nSpeaker 2: Arch. Yeah. Arch. Yeah. What is that?\n\nRebalancing platform.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, that's right. It's more it's models and things like that. Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: But, you know, things like there's a UI UX company, SDKs, pretty interesting in terms of, like, you know, the next Apple shows up and wants to just quickly be able to spin up. Things like proxy, which no one gives a shit about. There's a bunch of\n\nSpeaker 0: interesting things out\n\nSpeaker 2: there for Product. So there's pieces of that platform that are floating around\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: And not surprising. Many of them spawned during the pandemic or right before it. Yeah. Money was flowing. Built really good Product, can't find scale.\n\nYeah. So it's a good example of proxy. I mean, people built some amazing proxy tools that are much better than the shit that Broadridge puts out there. Yeah. But no one wants to leave Broadridge because they have a that they and they're smart.\n\nThey're savvy people at Broadridge. They have hooks in, and we're one of them. Like, I'm not leaving. No. I can't.\n\nSpeaker 0: You can't leave. Yeah?\n\nSpeaker 2: No. No. If if I could find someone to buy that actually did it and move my business in a lift and shift, the yeah. That's Marketing. But I'm certainly not gonna partner with somebody other than because they have them.\n\nYeah. Well, it's a good example. Like, there's a bunch of stuff out there\n\nSpeaker 0: that we\n\nSpeaker 2: think is Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, substantial if you look at Baldrige's numbers, substantial amount of their revenues are low, like, insane amounts of revenue on that puppy alone. Got it, Michael. Do you wanna just just a quick one. Just a\n\nSpeaker 1: So where we're where we're at, we've, as John alluded to, we've we've built out the platform. So we've got the the, the low code, no code generator. We've got the what we're calling digital warehouse 4.0, which is the modern re it's a more modern than what InvestCloud has version of the, of the data model there.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then what we've done\n\nSpeaker 1: is we've completed all of the designs, and we and we're really in build mode right now for the client portal and the adviser portal UI on top of that. And, you know, as as John alluded to, we'd like things in general square shape, so we we leaned towards the, the the serial numbers, and there there's a couple good reasons for that. 1, the modularity really sells well. It caters to people's desire to buy and customize, but to still deliver in a prioritized way, which has worked out really well for us in the past. So we think that it will continue to do so, but it also gives us the ability to make even even more than we did previously, we're going to configure these things as complete, unique, packaged products with a literal serial number just like they do on airplanes.\n\nRight? You know it's this part because it's got the number on it, and you're not gonna put the wrong one into the air conditioning unit or, god forbid, whatever they put on that going door. But the,\n\nSpeaker 3: the The\n\nSpeaker 0: conditioning. Outside air conditioning.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. Outside air conditioning. Right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. They should be confused.\n\nSpeaker 0: Confusing. Yeah. Like a nut.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, you know, and and, you know, what we spent a lot of time doing, right at the start was actually taking everything we knew about client and adviser experiences and really putting it into those component parts. And so the, you know, the the list here that you see is completely, you know, sort of up to date in terms of its ability to, you\n\nSpeaker 0: know oops.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know why.\n\nSpeaker 0: So when when,\n\nSpeaker 2: and so Yeah. Competitively so I get a couple of interesting parts. One is, like, there's a better version of the Invesco.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yep. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you can see where we're I mean,\n\nSpeaker 2: it's competitively, like, there's no there's we're under NDA.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like, there's no issues around actually turning around and That that wasn't it.\n\nSpeaker 0: That would pre February, whatever date it was, there would have been issues.\n\nSpeaker 2: Hand handcuffs are off. Great job. Hand. That was 1\n\nSpeaker 0: and 2.\n\nSpeaker 2: So but but 2 is because this is really interesting to us. It's like the goal is to is to create that sort of front office Yeah. Experience\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: For the and and the buyer would be similar to what you're selling. Investify a large enterprise, smaller advisors, both Exactly the size. I mean, at at\n\nSpeaker 0: the end of at the end of the day.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is really interesting.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. So this is the design book.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So because I'll tell you, what's interesting, John, is like and this is what we're talking about. Like, we can make like, clients are gonna you need to provide Client choice. So let's just say people wanna use this and custody of Schwab.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. Fine.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. That's fine.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. People wanna custody Apex and Orion. Yeah. Fine. Fine.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yep. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: The way it works. Right? Yeah. Yeah. But there is that sort of, like, like, sort of line up the stars and say, okay.\n\nYeah. But this and Apex\n\nSpeaker 3: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 2: Like, there is this is what we were doing back when it was like, let's lean in and figure out how to actually make account Marketing, 8 caps, like That's facts. Either as software\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Which is a little bit\n\nSpeaker 2: tricky but Marketing. Right? If you were to go to JPMorgan Yep. And Sales, you draw your circles further down\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: And say, say, okay. This platform includes an ACAT service, account opening service Yeah. Yeah. And down, meaning you Sales custody, we can provide software in partnership with our friends at Apex. On the other side is to Sales, like, Apex and walk in and Sales, like, look, There's a turnkey solution, which has eluded us for 10 years.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Super frustrating\n\nSpeaker 1: to me because To them, I'm 2 advisors.\n\nSpeaker 2: And frogs and it's just Yeah. It I'm so tired of it. Right? So as a good example, Orion really leaned in. Eric was a friend of the firm.\n\nMhmm. And now Eric's not the guy and that relationship is shit again. Yeah. And I understand it because she's got her hands full and that place is a mess\n\nSpeaker 0: and she\n\nSpeaker 2: can't do anything new. She's gotta focus on looking backwards at Orion, Natalie. Doesn't help us. No. And and the good news is we're winning.\n\nRight? It's like Becca's it's a good example. You guys should talk to her. Like, this firm is rocking and rolling.\n\nSpeaker 0: It's awesome. Yeah. No.\n\nSpeaker 2: We know. It just is and and so, like but the problem is is we're walking into firms. It's like, okay. Well, show us what you have. Yeah.\n\nOn the advisory front, this is not a that that stars aligned, whatever you wanna call Client. The one that, like, in the middle And and Bill doesn't work.\n\nSpeaker 0: Partnership with us and you in instantly, what it what it what it what it instantly does is is that we gain credibility because of you in terms of the maturity curve. And then we have credibility anyway because they know that we we're lead designers in this area. And we're walking the door like, we already have all the relationships. Yeah. You know, all the people that\n\nSpeaker 2: we\n\nSpeaker 0: all know the same people. We can walk in the room to Mary Erdos. We can walk into Dave Chubak. We can walk into every single name that you can think of. And when we turn up, they say, oh, we know what?\n\nWe're glad this bit. What was it, Bert? I can't remember who said, call me when the smart pickers everyone was predicting that, you know, that I will go back and the team will go back and we'll sort it out. And, somebody said, I can't remember which one is it? It came from you, I thought.\n\nIt's almost one of the smart people.\n\nSpeaker 3: Oh, yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: When when we left, obviously, Noelle was the top sales person.\n\nSpeaker 3: Weird. I said that. Maybe. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Was it was it Yeah. Okay. Tell us when the smart people return. You know? But the thing is that the the\n\nSpeaker 3: They're waiting for the calls. The\n\nSpeaker 0: reality was exactly what you said, Bill. Like some people just wanna come in and Sales, let's change colour. I actually just wanna buy Total Platform. You come in this way. Oh, no.\n\nI wanna I wanna do the software experience.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. And then later, they move this way or they don't. Yeah. But the thing is, there is a person out there who, you know, we already know because, you know, we're already in the market. We've we've even got our first engaged client where we're looking at their data.\n\nYep. You know, we know who they are. You know, it's it's very easy thing and we'll just get going. But the good news is is that we also know there's a market because, you know, here's a book of business. Well, a third of that book is in play in the next 18 months and it will move.\n\nYeah. Yeah. It's gotta go. It will go somewhere. And the thing is with us from a scratch, it's a little bit, you know, the mature I call it the maturity maturity curve of a company.\n\nBecause when you start, doesn't matter who you are. If this is time and you start, this is maturity. You start how I don't care who you are.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Because when you walk through the door, everyone's excited to see me and say, oh god, John, what have you got? You know, you know, is it let proceed or what is it? But it does it doesn't go like that. Yeah. Only way you get here is by doing merging into something.\n\nYeah. And, you know, it could be like Communify, you know, an OPEX clearing company and then it operates like this and we go around and then, you know, and it it does that. That instantly has that effect Mhmm. Instantly. And then, you know, and then you can you can actually sign bigger deals here because down here Yeah.\n\nYou're on you're in There's\n\nSpeaker 1: some early adoption Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Discounts you have to get. Right? We would be signing deals at 2.50, but in reality, it should be 7.50. Yeah. And that's just what we do.\n\nWe always discount the price initially because we want names. We want the beachheads. And once we've got the beachheads, the price goes up to everyone else who comes in. Yep. We know everyone.\n\nYeah. You've done that. Of course, you've done that. And then we would just do this. Also, the thing on the Marketing, Bill, people would if they saw you and I again with our teams, everyone will go, oh, shit.\n\nYeah. That is sexy. Saying it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. So so but so, like, if we were to draw this platform and put all the boxes of, like, what it what let's go back to the platform. K? And start from the front office.\n\nYep.\n\nSpeaker 0: It's you know, there's\n\nSpeaker 2: a b to c side all the way through to settle and trade through TTCC.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: And we drew every box. Right? Microsoft we call Microsofts. Every Microsofts. And we said, okay.\n\nWe know the ones we've got. We know the ones we're focused on, and we know which ones we're gonna do next. K? And it's like this swath. I'd I'd, like, love to understand kinda when you think about, you know, these guys hear me say all the time.\n\nLet's say say you walk back through the door and it's 24 months from now, 18 months from now. What does it look like? Like, what is it?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can draw those boxes at a high level. Can you take\n\nSpeaker 0: them off?\n\nSpeaker 3: Those are in there.\n\nSpeaker 2: Or if they're in there, is there is there another spot?\n\nSpeaker 1: This is, like, one of\n\nSpeaker 0: one of the\n\nSpeaker 2: static Wait. We need more Can we turn it around?\n\nSpeaker 1: Push down the lever there. Look at that. Wow.\n\nSpeaker 3: We'll just start Marketing on the walls and waiting\n\nSpeaker 0: to you\n\nSpeaker 3: don't mind, but\n\nSpeaker 1: So you've got, you know, settlement. Custody. I'm always afraid of mine the moment I get the because it's not really that legible. But Tell me.\n\nSpeaker 0: Can't imagine what that word could've been.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I'll I'll I'll call it the the ops side of that. So this is, you know, this is whether it's adviser or or middle middle back office. Right? So you've got the digital that you need to have advisers and middle office and back office office teams in play\n\nSpeaker 0: to be able to use.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right? But then it it moves really into, like, the\n\nSpeaker 0: what I would call\n\nSpeaker 1: the adviser as portfolio manager, the adviser as relationship manager, right, where this is a lot more of the goals based planning and the CRMs and the content and the things that actually drives the relationship with the Client, and this is the, like, investment execution and rebalancing and those different types of things. Right? And then you get the and then you get the client experience.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right? We are really very focused right there, right, in the mode of of that.\n\nSpeaker 2: And then the rest of the PM part is through partnerships is the plan?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Because we we we think like just let me do this for a sec, Michael. We think like this bill. We think in pyramids. And and basically, we will say, this is your infrastructure pyramid.\n\nYou need all of this infrastructure. However, where you get most of the value is the opposite way around. It's like, you know, there's very little this is the differentiation pyramid of value. This isn't what it takes. Lots and lots of shit.\n\nAnd what you guys do is really heavy shit. Yeah. What you're telling me\n\nSpeaker 2: is we're like that little piece of shit on the bottom. God. And I'm full blown up. By the way, I totally agree. And one of the things is funny, literally talked about it this Marketing, and I said, no one gives a shit if you have the best proxy service on the planet.\n\nNo one gives a shit. It doesn't drive any more clients to you. Not. What drives clients is that private office solution. And what funny.\n\nIt's saying it's saying, like, it's not to say that we should abandon looking at things like proxy because I actually think there's real value there. Yeah. Mhmm. Because you need the infrastructure to be amazing. And, like, the one part I will tell you is that back to you said about competitors, they're all shit.\n\nMhmm. Schwab, Fidelity, Axos, PMR, they all suck. Yeah. So there's a real differentiation if you could walk in and be like, no. No.\n\nWait a second. You open an account in seconds with no paperwork.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Mhmm. Like,\n\nSpeaker 2: how the hell do you do that? With that said, we have really this is my fault because I'm a plumber. Have really not cared as much about where you're showing that value is. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is not in our DNA because I like the plumbing part, and we're focusing much more on that front.\n\nSpeaker 0: Bill, the diagram that we would have to do, this this is a client portal stack. Yeah. This this puppy here.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is actually interesting. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: And then the the diagram that you have underneath it is the plumbing diagram, which would be you, and that'd be sort of an upside down picture. So Yeah. You can get all of this on this, but you can use all of this as well.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well and and part of it is, like, you guys know this is like, well, you're gonna you're gonna opt obfuscate the custodian. You're gonna say, look. We're gonna take everyone's starter date files. We got you. You use Schwab?\n\nFine. You use Fidelity. We got you. Yeah. And sort of make it such that who cares who you use?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: K? The reality is the the the story that's you know, the the story track is there actually is, you know, sort of a 1 on 1 equals 3. So I go through these and say, like, there is a whole bunch of stuff in here.\n\nSpeaker 0: Going to do adviser. Opening,\n\nSpeaker 2: account overview, money movements\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Where Go to this, dear friend. You you you watch are more relevant when you get to the adviser page. You're gonna just because it becomes, like, closer to to you there. Yeah. Exactly.\n\nRight.\n\nSpeaker 2: And so so but you're gonna stay focused on the adviser?\n\nSpeaker 0: Or And the both of those, client and adviser. Just in Okay.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, wait. Wait. Wait. But this but nothing as it relates to, Marketing Up. Apple shows up at my doorstep.\n\nThey want a self directed UI UX. Yeah. Right? They need a custodian. They're coming to us.\n\nSpeaker 0: We we would do that as So Yeah. Look. The other project we've\n\nSpeaker 2: But but hold on,\n\nSpeaker 0: John. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: It's very different. I know. Let me just tell you, like, I know this.\n\nSpeaker 0: As you\n\nSpeaker 2: know, I've been in both these worlds. Right? The difference between a platform to support I'll make it up. SoFi. Yeah.\n\nRight. UI UX multi you know? Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. You\n\nSpeaker 2: know, multi tenant platform\n\nSpeaker 0: for that\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Versus what you guys historically know, which is, like, this for,\n\nSpeaker 0: I\n\nSpeaker 2: don't know, Mariner.\n\nSpeaker 3: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 2: They are so different Yeah. In a lot of ways.\n\nSpeaker 0: Don't don't lose sight, though, Bill. If you went and saw us in Asia, Citi and things with retail.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Citi and Chase are both\n\nSpeaker 0: We would never have. We we you know, basically, Hong Kong said, we need 5 challenger banks. And Citibank said, well, we're we're no one here. We're gonna be a challenge, and they got a Challenger Bank Client. And the technology behind that Challenger Bank was\n\nSpeaker 1: us.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: So so, you know, we\n\nSpeaker 2: Chris, because I and what I want to figure out for us in a selfishly is I'd much rather have one Sales, throat to choke. I'd rather have one partner that helps create sort of one UI, UX UX solution that spans from the next Weebill Yeah. Through to the traditional adviser in a Utopian world. The problem today is, like, I have to try and solve this left and right.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, and by the way, the last part is it's bookends today. So think about the end client. You walk through the front door. You get a choice of I'm gonna use Webull, Betterment, any of these left\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 2: Fully self directed, whether it's you're pointing and clicking or not\n\nSpeaker 0: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: Or I get Michael, my, you know, FA. FA. Yeah. Yeah. The in between there doesn't exist.\n\nThere's people that are trying this hybrid thing, but today doesn't exist and partly because no one got has gotten this right.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Be be wise, I said this 1,000,000 sometimes people. The digital world Marketing the first the first phase of it failed. It wasn't because it wasn't right. It's because the execution wasn't right.\n\nThat's what's happened. It wasn't that it was wrong. It's just that you got the execution wrong. And also there's there was a belief at some point in the future, it will be pretty much the same. Your experiences will be like, you know, for someone like me, I'm completely honest with you.\n\nI'm not sure if you're will be like, you know, someone like me, I'm completely lazy. I just phone up my personal banker. I even move in small amounts of money. He's you know, Brian, my my banker Sales, I feel like you're an assistant sometimes. No.\n\nCan't you even move, like, you know, $200 mine was a bit dirty by the end of the day. Right. But, you know, my view on it, Bill, what we you know, you could do this is NewCo. We could contribute, Communify. You could come contribute certain software components into this modular land.\n\nYeah. And then we can go to market Yeah. At these different types of people, and they they are different as you rightly say. Because when you look at what you have to do in retail, retail in Hong Kong, you had to see that system is mad. Okay.\n\nYou know, everyone was competing with each other. Like, on your phone, I could say to you, Liam, I I guess you as my friend to brag about my stock trading during the day. Yeah. And the scenario that we modelled, this Sales a great scenario. Michael did it one handed.\n\nWhere's your phone, Michael? Give me give me your phone.\n\nSpeaker 2: Impossible. That's dangerous.\n\nSpeaker 0: So my Michael would be there, and the scenario was this. And Michael did this, like, with all the Citibankers in Hong Kong. He says, I've come into work. Yeah. I'm sort of reading the news and and and and the light on on the on the bullet, whatever.\n\nYou get get into the thing and then sort of say, not the bullet, but the other trade. And then get into lunchtime, and I do all my insider trading information at lunch with my mates. And then I'm on the way back home, I'm sitting there, and I start trading. And Michael used to trade one handed on his phone. Yeah.\n\nAnd then tell people his Sales, and on your phone, you would see Michael real time trading because they're competitive. And we said, look. We have to wait. They like competing with each other. They bet on anything in Hong Kong.\n\nAnything. And then I and then there's, like, I think it was a brilliant, brilliant system. Wasn't it, Michael?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's cool.\n\nSpeaker 0: That was wonderful. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: It was Yeah. I I I like the idea. I like this notion of, like, contributing. I like the idea of new co. Yeah.\n\nWe should poke at that a bunch.\n\nSpeaker 0: And then and, Bill Bill, look. If you if we if you wanted to get external money in and actually get paid for something, that's true. Or does peak 6 wanna be the money?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: We sort of don't really care. Because money is money at the end of the day. Yeah. Just mention board members are different. Yeah.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. It it's yeah. It's really interesting. I again, I think and can I can I keep this? Or We\n\nSpeaker 0: can ship\n\nSpeaker 1: you one.\n\nSpeaker 0: Can you\n\nSpeaker 2: ship me one or send it?\n\nSpeaker 1: I can't quite give you that one because we need it for another. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: But I I'll just I'll just say\n\nSpeaker 3: again on that. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Just because I think I think part for me is, like, again, part of what's possible is, okay. You know, we we the page we had in here is like, okay. If you took these things and you said, okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: What a 5th page Marketing\n\nSpeaker 1: is the.\n\nSpeaker 0: Is that it? Not? Oh, it's yeah. Fispeech is. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. If you go through these things and you say, okay. We went down the list and we said, okay. Draw lines through the ones that Sales, you, you know, you guys in Apex, which of these things, if you actually leaned in and tightly integrated, what would it look like? So I'll give you an example.\n\nRight? Early versions of Apex. Yeah. We're pretty cool at what we did, but, you know, it still was start of the day. Now this new platform Ascend\n\nSpeaker 0: This is your platform, Bill. Yeah. Ascend. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. It's all real time. So real time position and balances, real time ledger. That's great. You guys don't have to build a damn thing.\n\nWe just plug in a real time ledger. Now mind you, this goes back to, like, okay. But if you wanna keep using Schwab, this won't work. Yeah. Now the part that is interesting is that you can contribute this code as software.\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Bill, that's what you need to do. I know it's an oxymoron in some ways, but because you own it, you got both sides of the equation. Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: The problem inside the company, and this is where I think it's would be fun to work together, is the gravitational pull. Right? So\n\nSpeaker 3: So it's\n\nSpeaker 2: gonna make the Star Wars, like, the tractor beam\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Pull inside this organization is always gonna be towards the custodian. Right. Yeah. This pull in terms of SaaS is not the muscle is not developed enough. Yeah.\n\nNow we have products and we're what's happening is we build this Ascend platform, which let's just say we're 75% of the way there. So there's real clients. So what's happening is there's live clients on it. Yep. It's equities.\n\nWhat we're doing is mutual funds, fixed income options.\n\nSpeaker 1: And this is what eliminates your reliance on Broadridge? Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm. Great. Yeah. Fantastic.\n\nSpeaker 2: So by the end of this year, it's now just about adding asset classes to the platforms. It works. There's a lot of clients on it using it for equity.\n\nSpeaker 0: And so does does, Google actually see this? Have they are they aware of what you've done or not? Not? Not really.\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, I have not been, I have been transparent with them, to a point Yeah. That's right. Where I can hand in my heart, Sales told you. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: And the reality of it is, they're gonna be happy to keep us as a client Yeah. Of some pieces of that puzzle. And maybe in this thing, their part are party to this, by the way. So, like, I'll give you a good example. Product, their UI work sucks, but the product of like, the actual processing of a of a, you know, proxy Yeah.\n\nIt is good. Good. Yeah. They have critical mass.\n\nSpeaker 0: They say they're on the market.\n\nSpeaker 2: I look at them and say, we'll be wed to them forever, and I don't think it's a bad thing. The good news is I won't be wed to them because I have to be anymore.\n\nSpeaker 0: And, Bill, at the end of the day, if we wanted another partner here to get them as another partner's, like, a call away because, you know, you you know they didn't turn up for no reason. Mhmm. And you saw who was there. So\n\nSpeaker 2: I did. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: So He's good dude. Yeah. And, you know, and the thing is, look, at the end of the day, you know, we wanna do something where the culture's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 0: You know, and the the the truth of the matter, although Tim is a really good dude. Culture's not right. The the culture's horrible. Yeah. And I I said, look.\n\nYou know, we would have to be like AMG or the Antetni comp. We would have to always be outside you because the thing is the the the reality because we're not we're not saying that doing these deals to sell the company. We're doing it to create the platform for maturity to get\n\nSpeaker 2: us going. This Marketing there. I mean, you think about what the the fucking debacle that they have with UBS. Like Yeah. He needs a solution and the thing that he spent I don't even know what the number is astounding.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: And he ends up with I don't even know. I I mean, does anything work, or did they scrap the\n\nSpeaker 0: whole thing? No. No. No. They they claim various bits of it are live now.\n\nAnd, look, we were working on the other side of that project Yeah. Which was, I forget what it was even called. Was the UBS What was it? Yorktown. It was oh, yeah.\n\nYorktown. Yorktown. Yeah. Yeah. It was Yorktown.\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: And Was it UBS? UBS was with Broadridge. Right? UBS is with Broadridge. UBS.\n\nSpeaker 1: And they have the on their adviser side, they have that deal where But\n\nSpeaker 2: it's billions that they've spent. It's b. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: With a b. It is a b. Yeah. It's definitely a b. Well, have you seen how slowly they work,\n\nSpeaker 3: though? Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: I mean, there's no urgency at all. When we have a meeting, we'll we look like we're a 1000000 miles now, and that's sort of like, you know, just getting on a push bike and we're driving a Ferrari. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: That makes me sick. Right? Just thinking of how much shareholder value is loaded.\n\nSpeaker 0: Just\n\nSpeaker 2: anyway, maybe I would just say be careful with that one for for\n\nSpeaker 0: the reason. We don't have to talk about that at all.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I it's an interesting idea, though, because, like, their deep pockets, they're into a lot of firms. Right? Yeah. A lot of firms that are interesting to me. Ironically, as a good example, Broadridge now uses Apex for cost basis and tax report.\n\nSpeaker 0: So\n\nSpeaker 2: That's good. They've given up on offering those Sales products. They now basically white label Apex,\n\nSpeaker 1: which is like that's huge.\n\nSpeaker 0: You know one deal So we're already Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Kinda down this path\n\nSpeaker 0: with that. One deal we could do, Bill, quickly if you wanted to\n\nSpeaker 3: do this. Just put\n\nSpeaker 0: it on the table. Quickly if you wanted to do this. Just put it on the table. Mhmm. If if you said, we'll work out how we contribute this this.\n\nWe won't do that jump right off the bat because of, you know, you have to work out lots\n\nSpeaker 1: of things.\n\nSpeaker 0: We're gonna do it from a logical point of view. Yeah. Yeah. But we're not gonna do it through a contribution of software point\n\nSpeaker 3: of view\n\nSpeaker 0: because it's just\n\nSpeaker 2: value in Commercial partners or whatever you wanna call it.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yep. You could invest here whatever vehicle, 15,000,000, and these guys or whatever number you like. Let's say let's say let's just let's just say 15. And these guys, whatever these numbers, can invest 5. So these guys want to invest.\n\nI can do a deal with these guys in milliseconds at that price. They want to invest more than that. But we can say, look, we want to use you on you on the on the team. I want Tim on the team just because it inflates some of this model. We don't have to do that either, but you would be the stronger investor.\n\nWe've got an investment package out there. Some people have got it at these sort of numbers. I can send it to you tomorrow because, you know, we're at that moment. 6 in 4 weeks to 6 weeks time, we are gonna have to shit or get off the pot with someone. Yeah.\n\nAnd when we do, that sort of tied us in a little bit. We have got another bigger deal, but we still could do that as well. But yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So when do you think the product v one goes live? Q 3. That's\n\nSpeaker 1: what we're\n\nSpeaker 2: aiming for.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Q 1, the first I'd\n\nSpeaker 2: be really curious. One of the things that would be helpful, and this I'm glad Connor's here, is to Sales, like, let's let's we don't need to name the Client. But, like, we have a number of big, big Sales. Big deals. Well, I you should Sales, clients that have massive amounts of assets.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Like Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Close to a $1,000,000,000,000 in assets.\n\nSpeaker 0: Advice a big deal.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. It's a big deal. Yeah. K? We sign a contract.\n\nK? Now they're not moving all $1,000,000,000,000 $850,000,000,000 in assets to us, but we're solving for the small client. Yep. Right? Today, they have a minimum.\n\nI think it's $1,000,000. They wanna scale down to a $100,000. They can't do that\n\nSpeaker 0: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: Unless they do it for us. Yep. Great. Like, that is a rinse and repeat model that we keep winning on.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 2: If we took that and said a couple of those scenarios for just advisory, Let's just stick to advisory. Let's not talk about Apple. And said, okay. Q 3 of this year, what could we sell together? That would be really helpful for me to to get to this, John.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, you because we've we've got\n\nSpeaker 2: on the investment make sure it solves the Product.\n\nSpeaker 0: That's where send you the investment packet as the timeline. Line. Yeah. And you'll you'll see that a client portal q3, advise portal q4, planning q2 from memory of next year. Yep.\n\nSo that that's what we're we're thinking on those sort of look, this is a continual bus. They they mature, get more and more and more features, but we know all the feature lists. And we've got a low code platform, so it's fast. And also, you know, look, at the end of the day, that assumes a certain amount of investment. Certain things that you have, we we just not need\n\nSpeaker 2: to put\n\nSpeaker 0: a veneer on it. We don't even have build that much of it as long as it can fit in the component store. Yeah. And it works.\n\nSpeaker 2: I agree. Look. You could grab some of these things as your own or as part of NewCo and not have to build, like, as a good example, position and balances. I got it. Yeah.\n\nWe built it. So you're done.\n\nSpeaker 0: The cool stuff. Yeah. And you can take\n\nSpeaker 2: a starter day file from Schwab and run it through this thing, and it'll work.\n\nSpeaker 3: And just so we say it out loud, we're all using it now. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like, I I use Unify on\n\nSpeaker 3: a daily basis right now.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, and we\n\nSpeaker 2: say q Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: So so the the platform's live.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: You know, in terms of us using it, you can we can demonstrate it right this second on Michael's phone or my phone or whatever.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I just I wanna land the plane as far as, like, 3q3q4. If I if we sort of took our timeline\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: And we think about the personas we're trying to solve for Yeah. And line it up against what you guys are thinking about in terms of your path, it'd just be helpful to see that. Yeah. Because and it's very fortuitous timing because we're we're there's a bunch of acquisitions we're looking at in and around the space that, yeah, we got same for you, John. I gotta solve this.\n\nYeah. I'm a whole bunch of people. Everyone disappoints me. Everyone falls down. I'm tired of it.\n\nAnd Yeah. We have to\n\nSpeaker 0: solve this. The difference is is that, you know, being part of it is a different vibe, isn't it? I mean, we're not here selling the company as you know, but we were investment partners. However, you know, as long as we have, you know, the things that we simply want in 3 years, we have the right to sell it even if it's selling it to Pete 6\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Is the answer. You know, you build it up. Up. It's worth a lot of money or build, you know, whatever you want to do, but it needs to have an x because the thing is the value of it today is worth x. The value of it tomorrow is 100 of 1,000,000.\n\nYeah. And we know it's 100 of 1,000,000.\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm smiling because you've commented about exit. I will literally I'll be in I should say this by these 2 guys. I'll be 90, and I'll still own stock. I'll be a I'll pay for billionaire for\n\nSpeaker 0: the rest of the day.\n\nSpeaker 2: My kids and my grandkids will love running. I'll still be driving a pickup truck.\n\nSpeaker 0: You know that paper bill because people used to sort of say to me, but when I had NetTic, I was so and I was young. I was worth so much money, and people used to sort of say, you know, you must be worth a fortune. On paper, yes. Yes, I am. In reality, not so much.\n\nBut mind you, they used to point out, Bill. I don't know if I ever told you this, but I used to own a stately home. And people would say, you you say you're not rich, John, but you\n\nSpeaker 2: have not. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Because I I started off in the projects in South London. So when I bought the stately home, it was like my main sister Sales, are you fucking kidding me? And I just said, I bought it only because I cook. Yeah. Yeah?\n\nYeah. And I was\n\nSpeaker 2: My wife won't allow it to happen. I I would I would say this. These guys are like I don't I love what I do. I love what I do, and I love the path we're on, and I love the people I work with. And so, you know, we're not gonna stop until we are bigger than Schwab.\n\nYeah. There's no doubt, and it's really clear to me that someone has to step in and be, say, the next Schwab. But like that hybrid of Schwab and Broadridge, that's gonna be us and it'll be a $100,000,000,000 company. There's no doubt in my mind. Yeah.\n\nAnd so but it's gonna take time, and it's gonna take, energy, and I think it's gonna take partnerships with people that, that aren't part of the family today.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. And I I think that's the key. You know, plant within a plant greatness comes because of specialization and specialisation and focus. Yeah.\n\nAnd when you don't have to specialise in other people's areas, because we said this time, we are definitely not building any accounting. We're not even building a lightweight accounting engine because it's a pain in the ass, and, actually, to us, it's actually a distraction from this. As soon as you're here\n\nSpeaker 2: I mean, it's an amazing distraction. Way. I mean, it's very cool and somewhat, you know, sort of makes me hopeful on this because, like, you're getting to do the same thing and you learn from all of your mistakes.\n\nSpeaker 0: That's right. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: And do it right this time.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: With a blank piece of paper.\n\nSpeaker 0: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 2: Right? And a team that you trust, which, you know, doesn't happen often.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. It doesn't.\n\nSpeaker 2: In a street that that knows your name and can, you know, and sort of has faith in what you can do.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'll be you know, people generally, you you are our user. People love us. You know? Yeah. We yeah.\n\nWhen did everything wasn't Prospect. Out of 50 projects that we've run at one time, you're gonna have 5 of them going sideways because of a load of different reasons. And usually in truth, never the product or people bullshit issues. And one of the things was my favorite one was, how did they use that component? You know, this component numbering?\n\nThe reason why it's on there because people used to use the wrong fucking components, and they pick them up from the library. And we're sort of saying, didn't we decommission that component and it's now part of a you know? And you have to go and fix it Yeah. Because someone picked up the wrong fucking thing.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So okay. So if you guys can send this to me, I mean, I I need to do an NDA. Yeah. I'd love to do this, like, persona thing quickly.\n\nYeah. And then send me the send me the\n\nSpeaker 0: stuff in your investment. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'll send you tomorrow the the reply to my boss.\n\nAny by the weekend, you'll get it. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 3: I have it on my don't worry. I have it on my list. I'll make sure he does it.\n\nSpeaker 0: No one was the best saleswoman in Best Cloud for a reason.\n\nSpeaker 3: I'll I'll get\n\nSpeaker 2: it done.\n\nSpeaker 0: She was\n\nSpeaker 3: lucky. Yeah. Luck. Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 0: You know that superpower? Did you ever see that movie? What is it? Deadpool.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: When the when the woman Client and he says, okay, okay, what's your superpower? And she says, I'm lucky. He says, that's a superpower. And if you watch that movie, it's the most hilarious thing because evidently Luck is a super fun.\n\nSpeaker 3: I'll take care\n\nSpeaker 0: of that.\n\nSpeaker 3: Well, at the end when he's got the\n\nSpeaker 0: thing on the neck Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 3: And he's got the code, and he says, what is what is the code?\n\nSpeaker 0: And she goes,\n\nSpeaker 1: 2. Oh. I\n\nSpeaker 2: I will say back to Becca Yeah. The thing that's really interesting is, the companies the DNA of the company is very similar.\n\nSpeaker 3: Oh, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. And I I\n\nSpeaker 2: It's actually a firm. We know that. We we obviously get along really well. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 3: I could see that, though.\n\nSpeaker 2: But but even now having people in the organization, and we have a few. There's a few people come across from\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. We got well, John Stewart. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 3: Oh, yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. John Stewart's normal.\n\nSpeaker 0: And I\n\nSpeaker 2: talked to one other person, which I should probably talk to you about offline. That actually South? Who's your right hand lady? Fiona. Fiona introduced me to\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll talk to her\n\nSpeaker 0: right now. Oh, I know who does.\n\nSpeaker 2: K. Yeah. You got the DNA?

Right now, historically, we've really been focused on that back end, and we've been very, you know, diligent at executing on that back end side. But we've started to move away or, you know, just never really focused as much on that front end and middle side Mhmm. Of of the opportunity. And one thing that Bill, Connor, and a few other folks and I were speaking about is, like, how can we more adeptly empower different entities, whether it be enterprises, whether it be non US entities Yeah. Whatever it might be by giving them, like, that full full suite of solutions from that front office, like a front office white label or user interface Yeah. Middle office and back office. Yeah. So that's one thing that we're just really thinking through and and figuring out, okay. How can we just empower them and maybe give them, as Bill mentioned, like, that two sides of the same coin approach, where on one side, you would have the clearing and custody and everything that we've traditionally been good at. Yeah. But then on the other side, offer out as many of these products as possible modularly so that you're able to support entities that may have their own balance sheet and may wanna do the clearing and custody themselves. Yeah. That's right. But through offering them different point solutions That's right. Based on experience. So Yeah. So I can't help myself out. So so I think the step the piece in the middle that I think is important to understand. So so the purpose of Apex, help every person on the planet invest. Yeah. Yeah. Right? But we're not b to c people. Mhmm. Right? And it's interesting. We've had number of opportunities most, you know, most recently, like, last week, big firms, b to c, some of which are Client saying, hey, would you buy us? And Oh, god. Would you buy them? Yeah. Well, like, so far Well, think about it. Like that. Well, think about it. Right? So I think about the biggest wealth managers on at least let's just talk about in the United Sales, kind of on the planet. Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, Morgan Stanley. Yep. Those are the top 4. Not even close after that. Yeah. Yeah. K? What do all 4 have in common? The b to b and the b to c. Yeah. On the retail side. Yeah. K. So, like, k, it's kinda interesting thought notion. Right? It's like, is there a modern version of that? Yeah. The reality is we're not b to c people.","start_word":1807,"end_word":2246,"sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_score":0.06616037542169745},{"text":"No. And I think it become a distraction.

At least for right now, b to c is not really where we wanna focus. Right. But we think about us as a platform. Alright? The one thing I will say is that every dollar invested else. Every dollar. So you're trying 1,000,000,000,000 and 1,000,000,000,000,000,000, and you guys know this stuff on Twitter. Of course. None. Are you thinking of this platform? Yeah. And when Liam talks about 2 sided coin, I think of that platform as one platform that serves kind of 2 different sides of our industry. K? So you build this thing the right way, and we'll get into, like, where it starts and ends. But, like, if you build the platform the right way, you apply capital, modern custodian. That is Apex. That's what we've been Yeah.","start_word":2269,"end_word":2405,"sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_score":0.0694580078125},{"text":"That's what we talk about our the journey, but, like, if you take the same platform and you thank you.","start_word":2406,"end_word":2425,"sentiment":"positive","sentiment_score":0.33642578125},{"text":"You're welcome.","start_word":2426,"end_word":2427,"sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_score":0.14453125},{"text":"You're the best.

If if you take the same platform and you just offer it as software Yeah. Could you offer a software as a one big monolith, Sales monolith, but one big platform Yeah. And or b go to market as discrete microservices. Yeah. Right? That make up that platform. Yeah. That's the path on the sort of other side of the same coin. It's the same platform. Yeah. So you think about, like, we're going to market with an ACAT service. Yeah. Right? It's just ACATs. Yeah. Right? And we would walk into Yeah. You know, go back to InvestCloud and say, like, look. Let's partner up. We're InvestCloud. Yeah. Okay. And anybody that uses the platform can sign up to use this kickass real time cloud native ACAT service. Yep. Right? And then it's, you know, landing and expands. Like, okay. They get and this is what we're doing. It's like, okay. Cost basis, tax reporting down the line, which is all the pieces that make up that wealth platform. Yeah. The question is, for us, this is where these this fun conversation with John is, we've drawn the lines historically of Apex sort of in the same place that everyone else in our industry has drawn. Right? In this sort of custodial middle office, back office lines. Yeah. K? The lines aren't drawn in the right place Yeah. From my standpoint. Yeah. Right? And I think the opportunities for the industry do something different disruptive is like, okay. Erase the lines and sort of redraw them. So for us, when we think about that platform, wealth platform and by the way, retail wealth is where we're focused. Yeah. Right. We're not focused on institutional retail US wealth. Yep. K. So let's also qualify that. Yep. Like, do I think it'd be great if we could create this platform and it works in Japan for Japanese securities? Great. Yes. But not not for now. Yeah. So what we're trying to sort of think about is where do we draw the lines for that platform. Yeah. Yeah. Right? Does it include, let's just take the advisory world. Does it take a planning planning software? And, again, go back to the 2 sided coin. Everything we do is gonna be offered as software, so it's gonna be packaged in as part of our custodial plat platform. Yep. K? Both sides of this thing. That's that is the strategy for this company. And so the question is, how far north do we go in terms of defining sort of the boundaries of this wealth platform. Yeah. Yeah. And we don't have a great answer on it. And by the way, that whole world up there Yeah. Isn't really our forte, as you guys know, know, which is why John and I got along so well. Yeah. You know? Like Oh, no. It's I'm good at the shit we do. Yeah. You are. You guys are good at the shit you do. You're a big company. But the opportunity is somewhere in between. Yeah. Right? Which is why we talked about putting the companies there. Yeah. Yeah. And I I think it's you you know what you said about, you know, when I talk to my b to c base, they think differently to us. They're not thinking in the same way, but that is the reason why they're terrible at software and that they're terrible at custody and platforms.","start_word":2440,"end_word":3020,"sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_score":0.03629997634231121},{"text":"They're just terrible.","start_word":3021,"end_word":3023,"sentiment":"negative","sentiment_score":-0.44775390625},{"text":"And But they are great at a client experience.

In a better way than we would ever understand them. Yep. And I you know, when I look at it, it's like the these these are the these are the sort of worlds that we live in. And a plant is what he wrote. And these guys notice backwards. Yeah. So a plant within a Client. And he he really initially wrote it about, industries in America. And you can look you can look it up. It's about 19 seventies when it when this was first written. And and, basically, what he said is that corporate America is preoccupied with, integration. So they buy things and they feel like they have to integrate. And his argument is that that is actually the last thing that you need to do. All you need to do is have very set boundaries of how they interact interact with each other and that will give you efficiency. In InvestCloud, if you went through InvestCloud, if you saw our accounting team, because we did, unfortunately, do accounting, but our accounting team looked a certain way. When you saw our designers, our designers are covered in oh, you say you can spot the designers a mile away. They're covered in tattoos. And the accountants haven't got haven't seen a tattoo. Yep. And we didn't ever put them together because they don't they don't hang with each other. They're they're nothing in common. Yep.

Let us quickly show you the future. And just I just wanna go I don't wanna do anything else but go to the component store. Okay. Yeah. Because the thing is, for the you guys on a limb, let's show you what the component store looks like. Because, you know, when we build things, we come at it. Our DNA Sales modular. And this time around, what we've done even better is our components are so much more atomic, but also labelled very if you get if you get on a normal airplane, such as, Airbus, you'll notice I don't know if you even notice on the labels on the toilet, this is, like, open. It's actually got a number on you'll now know if you haven't seen that number before. You will see a number, and every part of a plane is numbered with a service so they know what all the things are. Yeah. So you can audit a plane for a set of numbers, and that is the DNA of a plane.

You booked something. What was it? Arch or something? Arch. Yeah. Arch. Yeah. What is that? Rebalancing platform. Oh, that's right. It's more it's models and things like that. Yep. But, you know, things like there's a UI UX company, SDKs, pretty interesting in terms of, like, you know, the next Apple shows up and wants to just quickly be able to spin up. Things like proxy, which no one gives a shit about. There's a bunch of interesting things out there for Product. So there's pieces of that platform that are floating around Yeah. And not surprising.

Well, substantial if you look at Baldrige's numbers, substantial amount of their revenues are low, like, insane amounts of revenue on that puppy alone. Got it, Michael. Do you wanna just just a quick one. Just a So where we're where we're at, we've, as John alluded to, we've we've built out the platform. So we've got the the, the low code, no code generator. We've got the what we're calling digital warehouse 4.0, which is the modern re it's a more modern than what InvestCloud has version of the, of the data model there. And then what we've done is we've completed all of the designs, and we and we're really in build mode right now for the client portal and the adviser portal UI on top of that. And, you know, as as John alluded to, we'd like things in general square shape, so we we leaned towards the, the the serial numbers, and there there's a couple good reasons for that.","start_word":4212,"end_word":4455,"sentiment":"neutral","sentiment_score":0.055084228515625},{"text":"1, the modularity really sells well.

And, you know, and and, you know, what we spent a lot of time doing, right at the start was actually taking everything we knew about client and adviser experiences and really putting it into those component parts. And so the, you know, the the list here that you see is completely, you know, sort of up to date in terms of its ability to, you know oops. I don't know why. So when when, and so Yeah. Competitively so I get a couple of interesting parts. One is, like, there's a better version of the Invesco. Yep. Yeah. And you can see where we're I mean, it's competitively, like, there's no there's we're under NDA. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

That was 1 and 2. So but but 2 is because this is really interesting to us. It's like the goal is to is to create that sort of front office Yeah. Experience Yeah. For the and and the buyer would be similar to what you're selling. Investify a large enterprise, smaller advisors, both Exactly the size. I mean, at at the end of at the end of the day. This is really interesting. Yeah. So this is the design book. Yeah. So because I'll tell you, what's interesting, John, is like and this is what we're talking about. Like, we can make like, clients are gonna you need to provide Client choice. So let's just say people wanna use this and custody of Schwab. Yep. Fine. Yeah. That's fine. Yeah. People wanna custody Apex and Orion. Yeah. Fine. Fine. Yep. Yeah. The way it works. Right? Yeah. Yeah. But there is that sort of, like, like, sort of line up the stars and say, okay. Yeah. But this and Apex Exactly. Like, there is this is what we were doing back when it was like, let's lean in and figure out how to actually make account Marketing, 8 caps, like That's facts. Either as software Yeah. Yeah. Which is a little bit tricky but Marketing. Right? If you were to go to JPMorgan Yep. And Sales, you draw your circles further down Yeah. And say, say, okay. This platform includes an ACAT service, account opening service Yeah. Yeah. And down, meaning you Sales custody, we can provide software in partnership with our friends at Apex. On the other side is to Sales, like, Apex and walk in and Sales, like, look, There's a turnkey solution, which has eluded us for 10 years. Yeah. Yeah. Super frustrating to me because To them, I'm 2 advisors. And frogs and it's just Yeah. It I'm so tired of it. Right? So as a good example, Orion really leaned in. Eric was a friend of the firm.

I wanna I wanna do the software experience. Yeah. Yeah. And then later, they move this way or they don't. Yeah.

If you went and saw us in Asia, Citi and things with retail. Yeah. Citi and Chase are both We would never have. We we you know, basically, Hong Kong said, we need 5 challenger banks. And Citibank said, well, we're we're no one here. We're gonna be a challenge, and they got a Challenger Bank Client. And the technology behind that Challenger Bank was us. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So so, you know, we Chris, because I and what I want to figure out for us in a selfishly is I'd much rather have one Sales, throat to choke.

The problem inside the company, and this is where I think it's would be fun to work together, is the gravitational pull. Right? So So it's gonna make the Star Wars, like, the tractor beam Yeah. Pull inside this organization is always gonna be towards the custodian. Right. Yeah. This pull in terms of SaaS is not the muscle is not developed enough. Yeah. Now we have products and we're what's happening is we build this Ascend platform, which let's just say we're 75% of the way there. So there's real clients.

They now basically white label Apex, which is like that's huge. You know one deal So we're already Yeah. Kinda down this path with that. One deal we could do, Bill, quickly if you wanted to do this. Just put it on the table. Quickly if you wanted to do this. Just put it on the table. Mhmm. If if you said, we'll work out how we contribute this this. We won't do that jump right off the bat because of, you know, you have to work out lots of things. We're gonna do it from a logical point of view. Yeah. Yeah. But we're not gonna do it through a contribution of software point of view because it's just value in Commercial partners or whatever you wanna call it. Yep. You could invest here whatever vehicle, 15,000,000, and these guys or whatever number you like. Let's say let's say let's just let's just say 15. And these guys, whatever these numbers, can invest 5. So these guys want to invest. I can do a deal with these guys in milliseconds at that price. They want to invest more than that. But we can say, look, we want to use you on you on the on the team. I want Tim on the team just because it inflates some of this model. We don't have to do that either, but you would be the stronger investor. We've got an investment package out there. Some people have got it at these sort of numbers. I can send it to you tomorrow because, you know, we're at that moment. 6 in 4 weeks to 6 weeks time, we are gonna have to shit or get off the pot with someone. Yeah. And when we do, that sort of tied us in a little bit. We have got another bigger deal, but we still could do that as well. But yeah. So when do you think the product v one goes live? Q 3. That's what we're aiming for. Yeah. Q 1, the first I'd be really curious.
